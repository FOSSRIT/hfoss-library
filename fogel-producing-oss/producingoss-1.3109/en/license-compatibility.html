proprietary-incompatible and proprietary-compatible licenses, that is,
between the copyleft licenses and everything else.  The canonical
example of a copyleft license is the GNU General Public License (along
with its network-oriented variant, the Affero GNU General Public
License or AGPL, introduced later in this chapter in <a class="xref" href="license-choosing.html#gnu-affero-gpl" title="The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code">the section called &#8220;The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code&#8221;</a>), and one of the most important
considerations in choosing the GPL or AGPL is the extent to which it
is compatible with other licenses.  For brevity, I'll refer just to
the GPL below, but most of this applies to the AGPL as well.</p><p>Because the primary goal of the GPL's authors is the promotion
of free software, they deliberately crafted the license to make it
impossible to mix GPLed code into proprietary programs.  Specifically,
among the GPL's requirements (see <a class="ulink" href="https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html" target="_top">https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html</a> for its full text) are
these two:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Any derivative work &#8212; that is, any work
            containing a nontrivial amount of GPLed code &#8212; must
            itself be distributed under the GPL.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>No additional restrictions may be placed on the
            redistribution of either the original work or a derivative
            work.  (The exact language is: "You may not impose any
            further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
            or affirmed under this License.")</p></li></ol></div><p>With these conditions, the GPL succeeds in making freedom
contagious.  Once a program is copyrighted under the GPL, its terms of
redistribution are
<em class="firstterm">reciprocal</em><sup>[<a name="idp3895" href="#ftn.idp3895" class="footnote">98</a>]</sup> &#8212; they are passed
on to anything else the code gets incorporated into, making it
effectively impossible to use GPLed code in closed-source programs.
However, these same clauses also make the GPL incompatible with
certain other free licenses.  The usual way this happens is that the
other license imposes a requirement &#8212; for example, a credit clause
requiring the original authors to be mentioned in some way &#8212; that
is incompatible with the GPL's "You may not impose any further
restrictions..." language.  From the point of view of the Free
Software Foundation, these second-order consequences are desirable, or
at least not regrettable.  The GPL not only keeps your software free,
but effectively makes your software an agent in pushing
<span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> software to enforce freedom as well.</p><p>The question of whether or not this is a good way to
promote free software is one of the most persistent holy wars on the
Internet (see <a class="xref" href="common-pitfalls.html#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">the section called &#8220;Avoid Holy Wars&#8221;</a>), and we won't
investigate it here.  What's important for our purposes is that
GPL compatibility is something to consider when choosing a license.  The
GPL is by far the most popular open source license, having more than
twice as many projects released under it as under the next most
popular licenses<sup>[<a name="idp3901" href="#ftn.idp3901" class="footnote">99</a>]</sup>.
If you want your code to be able to be
mixed freely with GPLed code &#8212; and there's a lot of GPLed code out
there &#8212; then you should pick a GPL-compatible license.  Most of
the GPL-compatible open source licenses are also
proprietary-compatible: that is, code under such a license can be used
in a GPLed program, and it can be used in a proprietary program.  Of
course, the <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span> of these mixings would not be
compatible with each other, since one would be under the GPL and the
other would be under a closed-source license.  But that concern
applies only to the derivative works, not to the code you distribute
in the first place.</p><p>Fortunately, the Free Software Foundation maintains a list
showing which licenses are compatible with the GPL and which are not,
at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html" target="_top">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>.  All
of the licenses discussed in this chapter are present on that list, on
one side or the other.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp3895" href="#idp3895" class="para">98</a>] </sup>Some people use the
term <em class="firstterm">viral</em> to describe the GPL's
contagiousness; they do not always mean this pejoratively, but I still
prefer "reciprocal" because it's more descriptive and less connotative
of disease.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp3901" href="#idp3901" class="para">99</a>] </sup>This statistic is based on an
aggregation of several license count sources, combined with some
reasonable definitional assumptions.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="license-aspects.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="legal.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="license-choosing.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Aspects of Licenses </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Choosing a License</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
