always like to complain about it.  This seems to be more true of bug
trackers than of any other standard development tool.  I think it's
because bug trackers are so visual and so interactive that it's easy
to imagine the improvements one would make (if one only had the time),
and to describe those improvements out loud.  Take the inevitable
complaints with a grain of salt&#8212;many of the trackers below are
pretty good.</p><p>Throughout these listings, the word "issue" is used to refer to
the items the trackers track.  But remember that each system may have
its own terminology, in which the corresponding term might be
"artifact" or "bug" or something else.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Note (2010-08-25): This survey was done in 2005, and some new open source bug trackers have been written since then.

its users pretty happy.  I've been using a modified variant of it in
my work for four years now, and like it.  It's not highly
customizable, but in a odd way, that may be one of its features:
Bugzilla installations tend to look pretty much the same wherever they
are found, which means many developers are already accustomed to its
interface and will feel they are in familiar territory.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="GNATS &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-gnats"></a><span class="bold"><strong>GNATS</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnats/" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/software/gnats/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>GNU GNATS is one of the oldest open source bug trackers, and is
widely used.  Its biggest strengths are interface diversity (it can
be used not just through a web browser, but also through email or
command-line tools), and plaintext issue storage.  The fact that all
issue data is stored in text files on disk makes it easier to write
custom tools to trawl and parse the data (for example, to generate
statistical reports).  GNATS can also absorb emails automatically by
various means, and add them to the appropriate issues based on
patterns in the email headers, which makes logging user/developer
conversations very easy.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="RequestTracker (RT) &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-rt"></a><span class="bold"><strong>RequestTracker (RT)</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/" target="_top">http://www.bestpractical.com/rt/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>RT's web site says "RT is an enterprise-grade ticketing system
which enables a group of people to intelligently and efficiently
manage tasks, issues, and requests submitted by a community of users,"
and that about sums it up.  RT has a fairly polished web interface,
and seems to have a pretty wide installed base.  The interface is a
bit visually complex, but that becomes less distracting as you get
used to it.  RT is licenced under the GNU GPL (for some reason, their
web site doesn't make this clear).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Trac &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-trac"></a><span class="bold"><strong>Trac</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://trac.edgewall.com/" target="_top">http://trac.edgewall.com/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Trac is a bit more than a bug tracker: it's really an integrated
wiki and bug tracking system.  It uses wiki linking to connect
issues, files, version control changesets, and plain wiki pages.  It's
fairly simple to set up, and integrates with Subversion (see <a class="xref" href="vc-systems.html" title="Ph&#7909; l&#7909;c A. Free Version Control Systems">Ph&#7909; l&#7909;c A, <i>Free Version Control Systems</i></a>).</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Roundup &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-roundup"></a><span class="bold"><strong>Roundup</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://roundup.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://roundup.sourceforge.net/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Roundup is pretty easy to install (only Python 2.1 or higher
is required), and simple to use.  It has web, email, and
command-line interfaces.  The issue data templates and web interface
are customizable, as is some of its state-transition logic.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Mantis &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-mantis"></a><span class="bold"><strong>Mantis</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mantisbt.org/" target="_top">http://www.mantisbt.org/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Mantis is a web-based bug tracking system, written in PHP, and
using MySQL database for storage.  It has the features you'd expect.
Personally, I find the web interface clean, intuitive, and easy on the
eyes.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Flyspray &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-flyspray"></a><span class="bold"><strong>Flyspray</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://www.flyspray.org/" target="_top">http://www.flyspray.org/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Flyspray is a web-based bug tracking system written in PHP.  Its
web pages describe it as "uncomplicated", and the list of features
includes: multiple database support (currently MySQL and PGSQL);
multiple projects; 'watching' tasks, with notification of changes (via
email or Jabber); comprehensive task history; CSS theming; file
attachments; advanced search features (though easy to use); RSS/Atom
feeds; wiki and plaintext input; voting; dependency graphs.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Scarab &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-scarab"></a><span class="bold"><strong>Scarab</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://scarab.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://scarab.tigris.org/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>Scarab is meant to be a highly customizable, full-featured bug
tracker, offering more or less the union of the features offered by
other bug trackers: data entry, queries, reports, notifications to
interested parties, collaborative accumulation of comments, and
dependency tracking.</p><p>It is customizable through administrative web pages.  You can
have multiple "modules" (projects) active in a single Scarab
installation.  Within a given module, you can create new issue types
(defects, enhancements, tasks, support requests, etc.), and add
arbitrary attributes, to tune the tracker to your project's specific
requirements.</p><p>As of late 2004, Scarab was getting close to its 1.0
release.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Debian Bug Tracking System (DBTS) &#8212; "><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-dbts"></a><span class="bold"><strong>Debian Bug Tracking System (DBTS)</strong></span> &#8212; <a class="ulink" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/debbugs/" target="_top">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/debbugs/</a></h3></div></div></div><p>The Debian Bug Tracking System is unusual in that all input and
manipulation of issues is done via email: each issue gets its own
dedicated email address.  The DBTS scales pretty well: <a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.debian.org/" target="_top">http://bugs.debian.org/</a> has 277,741 issues, for example.</p><p>Since interaction is done via regular mail clients, an
environment which is familiar and easily accessible to most people,
the DBTS is good for handling high volumes of incoming reports that
need quick classification and response.  There are disadvantages too,
of course.  Developers must invest the time needed to learn the email
command system, and users must write their bug reports without a
web form to guide them in choosing what information to write.  There
are tools available to help users send better bug reports, such as the
command-line <span class="command"><strong>reportbug</strong></span> program or the
<code class="systemitem">debbugs-el</code> package for Emacs.  But most
people won't use these tools; they'll just write email manually, and
they may or may not follow the bug reporting guidelines posted by your
project.</p><p>The DBTS has a read-only web interface, for viewing and
querying issues.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Trouble-Ticket Trackers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bugtrackers-trouble-ticket-trackers"></a><span class="bold"><strong>Trouble-Ticket Trackers</strong></span></h3></div></div></div><p>These are more oriented toward help desk ticket tracking than
software bug tracking.  You'll probably do better with a regular bug
tracker, but these are listed for the sake of completeness, and
because there could conceivably be unusual projects for which a
trouble-ticket system might be more appropriate than a traditional bug
tracker.</p><p>

bug tracker.  It offers privacy features that are somewhat unusual
among open source bug trackers: users of the system are categorized as
Staff, Friend, Customer, or Anonymous, and more or less data is
available depending on one's category.  It offers some email
integration, a command-line interface, and mechanisms for converting
emails into tickets.  It also has features for maintaining information
not associated with any specific ticket, such as internal
documentation or FAQs.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="vc-systems.html">Tr&#432;&#7899;c &#273;ó</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="bikeshed-full.html">K&#7871; ti&#7871;p</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Ph&#7909; l&#7909;c A. Free Version Control Systems </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">&#272;&#7847;u</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Ph&#7909; l&#7909;c C. Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
