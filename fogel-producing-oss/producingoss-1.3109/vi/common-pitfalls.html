that you have to respond to everything.  You don't.  First of all,
there will usually be more threads going on than you can keep track
of, at least after the project is past its first few months.  Second,
even in the threads that you have decided to engage in, much of what
people say will not require a response.  Development forums in
particular tend to be dominated by three kinds of messages:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Messages proposing something non-trivial</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Messages expressing support or opposition to
                  something someone else has said</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Summing-up messages</p></li></ol></div><p>None of these <span class="emphasis"><em>inherently</em></span> requires a
response, particularly if you can be fairly sure, based on watching
the thread so far, that someone else is likely to say what you would
have said anyway.  (If you're worried that you'll be caught in a
wait-wait loop because all the others are using this tactic too, don't
be; there's almost always <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> out there
who'll feel like jumping into the fray.)  A response should be
motivated by a definite purpose.  Ask yourself first: do you know what
you want to accomplish?  And second: will it not get accomplished
unless you say something?</p><p>Two good reasons to add your voice to a thread are a) when you
see a flaw in a proposal and suspect that you're the only one who sees
it, and b) when you see that miscommunication is happening between
others, and know that you can fix it with a clarifying post.  It's
also generally fine to post just to thank someone for doing something,
or to say "Me too!", because a reader can tell right away that such
posts do not require any response or further action, and therefore the
mental effort demanded by the post ends cleanly when the reader
reaches the last line of the mail.  But even then, think twice before
saying something; it's always better to leave people wishing you'd
post more than wishing you'd post less.  (See the second half of <a class="xref" href="bikeshed-full.html" title="Ph&#7909; l&#7909;c C. Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?">Ph&#7909; l&#7909;c C, <i>Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?</i></a> for more thoughts about how to behave on
a busy mailing list.)</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Productive vs Unproductive Threads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="productive-threads"></a>Productive vs Unproductive Threads</h3></div></div></div><p>On a busy mailing list, you have two imperatives.  One,
obviously, is to figure out what you need to pay attention to and what
you can ignore.  The other is to behave in a way that
avoids <span class="emphasis"><em>causing</em></span> noise: not only do you want your
own posts to have a high signal/noise ratio, you also want them to be
the sorts of messages that stimulate <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> people
to either post with a similarly high signal/noise ratio, or not post
at all.</p><p>To see how to do that, let's consider the context in which it is
done.  What are some of the hallmarks of an unproductive thread?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Arguments that have been made already start being
            repeated, as though the poster thinks no one heard them
            the first time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Increasing levels of hyperbole and involvement as
            the stakes get smaller and smaller.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A majority of comments coming from people who do
            little or nothing, while the people who tend to get things
            done are silent.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Many ideas discussed without clear proposals ever
            being made.  (Of course, any interesting idea starts out
            as an imprecise vision; the important question is what
            direction it goes from there.  Does the thread seem to be
            turning the vision into something more concrete, or is it
            spinning off into sub-visions, side-visions, and
            ontological disputes?)</p></li></ul></div><p>Just because a thread is not productive at first doesn't mean
it's a waste of time.  It might be about an important topic, in which
case the fact that it's not making any headway is all the more
troublesome.</p><p>Guiding a thread toward usefulness without being pushy is an
art.  It won't work to simply admonish people to stop wasting their
time, or to ask them not to post unless they have something constructive
to say.  You may, of course, think these things privately, but if you
say them out loud then you will be offensive.  Instead, you have to
suggest conditions for further progress&#8212;give people a route, a
path to follow that leads to the results you want, yet without
sounding like you're dictating conduct.  The distinction is largely
one of tone.  For example, this is bad:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This discussion is going nowhere.  Can we please
     drop this topic until someone has a patch to implement one of
     these proposals?  There's no reason to keep going around and
     around saying the same things.  Code speaks louder than
     words, folks.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Whereas this is good:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Several proposals have been floated in this
     thread, but none have had all the details fleshed out, at least
     not enough for an up-or-down vote.  Yet we're also not saying
     anything new now; we're just reiterating what has been said
     before.  So the best thing at this point would probably be for
     further posts to contain either a complete specification for the
     proposed behavior, or a patch.  Then at least we'd have a
     definite action to take (i.e., get consensus on the
     specification, or apply and test the patch).</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Contrast the second approach with the first.  The second way
does not draw a line between you and the others, or accuse them of
taking the discussion into a spiral.  It talks about "we", which is
important whether or not you actually participated in the thread
before now, because it reminds everyone that even those who have been
silent thus far still have a stake in the thread's outcome.  It
describes why the thread is going nowhere, but does so without
pejoratives or judgements&#8212;it just dispassionately states
some facts.  Most importantly, it offers a positive course of action,
so that instead of people feeling like discussion is being closed off
(a restriction against which they can only be tempted to rebel), they
will feel as if they're being offered a way to take the conversation
to a more constructive level.  This is a standard people will
naturally want to meet.</p><p>You won't always want a thread to make it to the next level of
constructiveness&#8212;sometimes you'll want it to just go away.  The
purpose of your post, then, is to make it do one or the other.  If you
can tell from the way the thread has gone so far that no one is
actually <span class="emphasis"><em>going</em></span> to take the steps you suggested,
then your post effectively shuts down the thread without seeming to do
so.  Of course, there isn't any foolproof way to shut down a thread,
and even if there were, you wouldn't want to use it.  But asking
participants to either make visible progress or stop posting is
perfectly defensible, if done diplomatically.  Be wary of quashing
threads prematurely, however.  Some amount of speculative chatter can
be productive, depending on the topic, and asking for it to be
resolved too quickly will stifle the creative process, as well as make
you look impatient.</p><p>Don't expect any thread to stop on a dime.  There will probably
still be a few posts after yours, either because mails got crossed in
the pipe, or because people want to have the last word.  This is
nothing to worry about, and you don't need to post again.  Just let
the thread peter out, or not peter out, as the case may be.  You can't
have complete control; on the other hand, you can expect to have a
statistically significant effect across many threads.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bikeshed"></a>The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate</h3></div></div></div><p>Although discussion can meander in any topic, the probability of
meandering goes up as the technical difficulty of the topic goes down.
After all, the greater the technical difficulty, the fewer
participants can really follow what's going on.  Those who can are
likely to be the most experienced developers, who have already taken
part in such discussions thousands of times before, and know what sort
of behavior is likely to lead to a consensus everyone can live
with.</p><p>Thus, consensus is hardest to achieve in technical questions
that are simple to understand and easy to have an opinion about, and
in "soft" topics such as organization, publicity, funding, etc.
People can participate in those arguments forever, because there are
no qualifications necessary for doing so, no clear ways to decide (even
afterward) if a decision was right or wrong, and because simply
outwaiting other discussants is sometimes a successful tactic.</p><p>The principle that the amount of discussion is inversely
proportional to the complexity of the topic has been around for a long
time, and is known informally as the <em class="firstterm">Bikeshed
Effect</em>.  Here is Poul-Henning Kamp's explanation of it,
from a now-famous post made to BSD developers:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's a long story, or rather it's an old story, but it is quite
short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a book in the early
1960'ies, called "Parkinson's Law", which contains a lot of insight
into the dynamics of management.</p><p>[...]</p><p>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the other vital
component is an atomic power-plant, I guess that illustrates the age
of the book.</p><p>Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and
get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar
atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be
tangled up in endless discussions.</p><p>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so
vast, so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, and
rather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody else
checked all the details before it got this far.  Richard P.  Feynmann
gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point, examples
relating to Los Alamos in his books.</p><p>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one of those
over a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV.  So no
matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with your
proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his
job, that he is paying attention, that he
is <span class="emphasis"><em>here</em></span>.</p><p>In Denmark we call it "setting your fingerprint".  It is about
personal pride and prestige, it is about being able to point somewhere
and say "There!  <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> did that."  It is a strong
trait in politicians, but present in most people given the chance.
Just think about footsteps in wet cement.</p></blockquote></div><p>(His complete post is very much worth reading, too.

<a class="ulink" href="http://bikeshed.com" target="_top">http://bikeshed.com</a>.)</p><p>Anyone who's ever taken regular part in group decision-making
will recognize what Kamp is talking about.  However, it is usually
impossible to persuade <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> to avoid painting
bikesheds.  The best you can do is point out that the phenomenon
exists, when you see it happening, and persuade the senior
developers&#8212;the people whose posts carry the most weight&#8212;to
drop their paintbrushes early, so at least they're not contributing to
the noise.  Bikeshed painting parties will never go away entirely, but
you can make them shorter and less frequent by spreading an awareness
of the phenomenon in the project's culture.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Avoid Holy Wars"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="holy-wars"></a>Avoid Holy Wars</h3></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">holy war</em> is a dispute, often but not
always over a relatively minor issue, which is not resolvable on the
merits of the arguments, but where people feel passionate enough to
continue arguing anyway in the hope that their side will prevail.
Holy wars are not quite the same as bikeshed paintings.  People
painting bikesheds are usually quick to jump in with an opinion
(because they can), but they won't necessarily feel strongly about it,
and indeed will sometimes express other, incompatible opinions, to
show that they understand all sides of the issue.  In a holy war, on
the other hand, understanding the other sides is a sign of weakness.
In a holy war, everyone knows there is One Right Answer; they just
don't agree on what it is.</p><p>Once a holy war has started, it generally cannot be resolved to
everyone's satisfaction.  It does no good to point out, in the midst
of a holy war, that a holy war is going on.  Everyone knows that
already.  Unfortunately, a common feature of holy wars is disagreement
on the very question of <span class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> the dispute is
resolvable by continued discussion.  Viewed from outside, it is clear
that neither side is changing the other's mind.  Viewed from inside,
the other side is being obtuse and not thinking clearly, but they
might come around if browbeaten enough.  Now, I am
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> saying there's never a right side in a holy
war.  Sometimes there is&#8212;in the holy wars I've participated
in, it's always been my side, of course.  But it doesn't matter,
because there's no algorithm for convincingly demonstrating that one
side or the other is right.</p><p>A common, but unsatisfactory, way people try to resolve holy
wars is to say "We've already spent far more time and energy
discussing this than it's worth!  Can we please just drop it?"  There
are two problems with this.  First, that time and energy has already
been spent and can never be recovered&#8212;the only question now is,
how much <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> effort remains?  If some people
feel that just a little more discussion will bring the issue to a
close, then it still makes sense (from their point of view) to
continue.</p><p>The other problem with asking for the matter to be dropped is
that this is often equivalent to allowing one side, the status quo, to
declare victory by inaction.  And in some cases, the status quo is
known to be unacceptable anyway: everyone agrees that some decision
must be made, some action taken.  Dropping the subject would be worse
for everyone than simply giving up the argument would be for anyone.
But since that dilemma applies to all equally, it's still possible to
end up arguing forever about what to do.</p><p>So how should you handle holy wars?</p><p>The first answer is, try to set things up so they don't happen.
This is not as hopeless as it sounds:</p><p>You can anticipate certain standard holy wars: they tend to come
up over programming languages, licenses (see
<a class="xref" href="license-compatibility.html" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">ph&#7847;n &#8220;The GPL and License Compatibility&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="legal.html" title="Ch&#432;&#417;ng 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Ch&#432;&#417;ng 9, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a></span>), reply-to munging (see
<a class="xref" href="mailing-lists.html#reply-to" title="The Great Reply-to Debate">ph&#7847;n &#8220;The Great Reply-to Debate&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="technical-infrastructure.html" title="Ch&#432;&#417;ng 3. Technical Infrastructure">Ch&#432;&#417;ng 3, <i>Technical Infrastructure</i></a></span>), and a few
other topics.  Each project 
usually has a holy war or two all its own, as well, which longtime
developers will quickly become familiar with.  The techniques for
stopping holy wars, or at least limiting their damage, are pretty much
the same everywhere.  Even if you are positive your side is right, try
to find <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> way to express sympathy and
understanding for the points the other side is making.  Often the
problem in a holy war is that because each side has built its walls
as high as possible, and made it clear that any other opinion is sheer
foolishness, the act of surrendering or changing one's mind becomes
psychologically unbearable: it would be an admission not just of being
wrong, but of having been <span class="emphasis"><em>certain</em></span> and still being
wrong.  The way you can make this admission palatable for the other
side is to express some uncertainty yourself&#8212;precisely by
showing that you understand the arguments they are making and find
them at least sensible, if not finally persuasive.  Make a gesture
that provides space for a reciprocal gesture, and usually the
situation will improve.  You are no more or less likely to get the
technical result you wanted, but at least you can avoid unnecessary
collateral damage to the project's morale.</p><p>When a holy war can't be avoided, decide early how much you
care, and then be willing to publicly give up.  When you do so, you
can say that you're backing out because the holy war isn't worth it,
but don't express any bitterness and <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> take
the opportunity for a last parting shot at the opposing side's
arguments.  Giving up is effective only when done gracefully.</p><p>Programming language holy wars are a bit of a special case,
because they are often highly technical, yet many people feel
qualified to take part in them, and the stakes are very high, since
the result may determine what language a good portion of the project's
code is written in.  The best solution is to choose the language
early, with buy-in from influential initial developers, and then
defend it on the grounds that it's what you are all comfortable
writing in, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> on the grounds that it's better
than some other language that could have been used instead.  Never let
the conversation degenerate into an academic comparison of programming
languages (this seems to happen especially often when someone brings
up Perl, for some reason); that's a death topic that you must simply
refuse to be drawn into.</p><p>For more historical background on holy wars, see <a class="ulink" href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/holy-wars.html" target="_top">http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/holy-wars.html</a>, and the
paper by Danny Cohen that popularized the term, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt" target="_top">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title='The "Noisy Minority" Effect'><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="noisy-minority"></a>The "Noisy Minority" Effect</h3></div></div></div><p>In any mailing list discussion, it's easy for a small minority
to give the impression that there is a great deal of dissent, by
flooding the list with numerous lengthy emails.  It's a bit like a
filibuster, except that the illusion of widespread dissent is even
more powerful, because it's divided across an arbitrary number of
discrete posts and most people won't bother to keep track of who said
what, when.  They'll just have an instinctive impression that the topic
is very controversial, and wait for the fuss to die down.</p><p>The best way to counteract this effect is to point it out very
clearly and provide supporting evidence showing how small the actual
number of dissenters is, compared to those in agreement.  In order to
increase the disparity, you may want to privately poll people who have
been mostly silent, but who you suspect would agree with the majority.
Don't say anything that suggests the dissenters were deliberately
trying to inflate the impression they were making.  Chances are they
weren't, and even if they were, there would be no strategic advantage
to pointing it out.  All you need do is show the actual numbers in a
side-by-side comparison, and people will realize that their intuition
of the situation does not match reality.</p><p>This advice doesn't just apply to issues with clear
for-and-against positions.  It applies to any discussion where a fuss
is being made, but it's not clear that most people consider the issue
under discussion to be a real problem.  After a while, if you agree that
the issue is not worthy of action, and can see that it has failed to
get much traction (even if it has generated a lot of mails), you can
just observe publicly that it's not getting traction.  If the "Noisy
Minority" effect has been at work, your post will seem like a breath of
fresh air.  Most people's impression of the discussion up to that
point will have been somewhat murky: "Huh, it sure feels like there's
some big deal here, because there sure are a lot of posts, but I can't
see any clear progress happening."  By explaining how the form of the
discussion made it appear more turbulent than it really was, you
retrospectively give it a new shape, through which people can recast
their understanding of what transpired.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="communications.html">Tr&#432;&#7899;c &#273;ó</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="communications.html">Lên</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="difficult-people.html">K&#7871; ti&#7871;p</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Ch&#432;&#417;ng 6. Communications </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">&#272;&#7847;u</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Difficult People</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
