presentable — you're ready to announce it to the world.</p><p>This is a simpler process than you might expect.  First, set up
the announcement pages at your project's home site, as described in
<a class="xref" href="ch06s07.html#announcing-releases" title="Announcing Releases and Other Major Events">the section called “Announcing Releases and Other Major Events”</a>)<span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span>.  Then, post announcements
in the appropriate forums.  There are two kinds of forums: generic
forums that display many kinds of new project announcements, and
topic-specific forums where your project would be welcome news.</p><p>Make sure the announcement includes key words and phrases that
will help people find your project in search engines.  A good test is
that if someone does a search for "open source foo bar baz", and your
project is a credible offering for foo, bar, and baz, then it should
be on the first page of results.  (Unless you have a lot of open
source competitors — but you don't, because you read
<a class="xref" href="ch02.html#look-around" title="But First, Look Around">the section called “But First, Look Around”</a>, right?)</p><p>As of late 2017, the best general forum for announcements is probably <a class="ulink" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">https://news.ycombinator.com/</a>.
While you are welcome to submit your project there, note that it will
have to successfully climb the word-of-mouth / upvote tree to get
featured on the front page.  The subreddit forums related to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/">https://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/</a>, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/software/">https://www.reddit.com/r/software/</a>
work in a similar way.  While it's good news for your project if you
can get mentioned in a place like that, I hesitate to contribute to
the marketing arms race by suggesting any concrete steps to accomplish
this.  Use your judgement and try not to spam.</p><p>You might also register your project at <a class="ulink" href="https://freshcode.club/">https://freshcode.club/</a>, and at <a class="ulink" href="http://openhub.net/">http://openhub.net/</a>, which is the closest
thing there is to a global database of free software projects and
their contributors, though it is somewhat desultorily
maintained.</p><p>Finally, topic-specific forums are probably where you'll get the
most interest.  Think of mailing lists or web forums where an
announcement of your project would be on-topic and of
interest — you might already be a member of some of
them — and post there.  Be careful to make exactly
<span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> post per forum, and to direct people to your
project's own discussion areas for follow-up discussion (when posting
by email, you can do this by setting the
<code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> header).  Your announcement should
be short and get right to the point, and the Subject line should make
it clear that it is an announcement of a new project:</p><pre class="screen">
To: discuss@some.forum.about.search.indexers
Subject: [ANN] Scanley, a new full-text indexer project.
Reply-to: dev@scanley.org

This is a one-time post to announce the creation of the Scanley
project, an open source full-text indexer and search engine with a
rich API, for use by programmers in providing search services for
large collections of text files.  Scanley is now running code, is
under active development, and is looking for both developers and
testers.

Home page: http://www.scanley.org/

Features:
   - Searches plain text, HTML, and XML
   - Word or phrase searching
   - (planned) Fuzzy matching
   - (planned) Incremental updating of indexes
   - (planned) Indexing of remote web sites
   - (planned) Long-distance mind-reading

Requirements:
   - Python 3.2 or higher
   - SQLite 3.8.1 or higher

For more information, please come find us at scanley.org!

Thank you,
-J. Random

<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span> for advice on announcing
subsequent releases and other project events.)</p><p>There is an ongoing debate in the free software world about
whether it is necessary to begin with running code, or whether a
project can benefit from being announced even during the
design/discussion stage.  I used to think starting with running code
was crucial, that it was what separated successful projects from toys,
and that serious developers would only be attracted to software that
already does something concrete.</p><p>This turned out not to be the case.  In the Subversion project,
we started with a design document, a core of interested and
well-connected developers, a lot of fanfare, and
<span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> running code at all.  To my complete surprise,
the project acquired active participants right from the beginning, and
by the time we did have something running, there were quite a few
developers already deeply involved.  Subversion is not the
only example; the Mozilla project was also launched without running
code, and is now a successful and popular web browser.</p><p>On the evidence of this and other examples, I have to back away
from the assertion that running code is absolutely necessary for
launching a project.  Running code is still the best foundation for
success, and a good rule of thumb would be to wait until you have it
before announcing your project<sup>[<a id="idm876" href="#ftn.idm876" class="footnote">26</a>]</sup>.  However, there may be circumstances where
announcing earlier makes sense.  I do think that at least a
well-developed design document, or else some sort of code framework,
is necessary — of course it may be revised based on public
feedback, but there has to be something concrete, something more
tangible than just good intentions, for people to sink their teeth
into.</p><p>Whenever you announce, don't expect a horde of participants to
join the project immediately afterward.  Usually, the result of
announcing is that you get a few casual inquiries, a few more people
join your mailing lists, and aside from that, everything continues
pretty much as before.  But over time, you will notice a gradual
increase in participation from both new code contributors and users.
Announcement is merely the planting of a seed.  It can take a long
time for the news to spread.  If the project consistently rewards
those who get involved, the news <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> spread,
though, because people want to share when they've found something
good.  If all goes well, the dynamics of exponential communications
networks will slowly transform the project into a complex community,
where you don't necessarily know everyone's name and can no longer
follow every single conversation.  The next chapters are about working
in that environment.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm876" href="#idm876" class="para">26</a>] </sup>Note that
<span class="emphasis"><em>announcing</em></span> your project can come long after you
have open sourced the code.  My advice to consider carefully the
timing of your announcement should not be taken as advice to delay
open sourcing the code — ideally, your project should
be open source and publicly visible from the very first moment of its
existence, and this is entirely independent of when you announce it.
