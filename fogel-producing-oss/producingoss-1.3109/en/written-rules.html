around in your project may become so great that you need to record it
somewhere.  In order to give such a document legitimacy, make it clear
that it is based on mailing list discussions and on agreements already
in effect.  As you compose it, link to the relevant threads in the
mailing list archives, and whenever there's a point you're not sure
about, ask again.  The document should not contain any surprises:
remember, it
is not the source of the agreements, it is merely a description of
them.  Of course, if it is successful, people will start citing it as
a source of authority in itself, but that just means it reflects the
overall will of the group accurately.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Linking To Emails"><a name="linking-to-emails"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Linking To Emails</b></p></div></div></div><p>When you link to an email thread in the archives, it's a good
practice to give not only the thread's URL, but the subject, sender
name, and date of the first message in the thread (or at least of some
message in the thread).  The reason is that archives sometimes
move &#8212; this is rarely desirable, but it still happens
from time to time, usually for political reasons or because of a change in
hosting provider &#8212; and the URL alone will usually not contain
enough information to find the message or thread in its new
location.</p><p>The same advice could apply to bug tickets too, but in practice
bug trackers move less often than mail archives do, and when a bug
tracker moves the project usually manages to either preserve the
ticket numbers or make a mapping between old and new ticket numbers,
so that old references can be resolved with a little extra effort.
For various technical reasons, this is harder to do with emails and
especially with threads, so the better solution is just for references
to include enough information to do a search in the new archive if
necessary.  See also <a class="xref" href="growth.html#using-archives" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">the section called &#8220;Conspicuous Use of Archives&#8221;</a>.</p></div><p>This is the document alluded to in <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html#developer-guidelines" title="Developer Guidelines">the section called &#8220;Developer Guidelines&#8221;</a>.  Naturally, when the
project is very young, you will have to lay down guidelines without
the benefit of a long project history to draw on.  But as the
development community matures, you can adjust the language to reflect
the way things actually turn out.</p><p>Don't try to be comprehensive.  No document can capture
everything people need to know about participating in a project.  Many
of the conventions a project evolves remain forever unspoken, never
mentioned explicitly, yet adhered to by all.  Other things are simply
too obvious to be mentioned, and would only distract from important
but non-obvious material.  For example, there's no point writing
guidelines like "Be polite and respectful to others on the mailing
lists, and don't start flame wars," or "Write clean, readable bug-free
code."  Of course these things are desirable, but since there's no
conceivable universe in which they might <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
desirable, they are not worth mentioning.  If people are being rude on
the mailing list, or writing buggy code, they're not going to stop
just because the project guidelines said to.  Such situations need to
be dealt with as they arise, not by blanket admonitions to be good.
On the other hand, if the project has specific guidelines about
<span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to write good code, such as rules about
documenting every API in a certain format, then those guidelines
should be written down as completely as possible.</p><p>A good way to determine what to include is to base the document
on the questions that newcomers ask most often, and on the complaints
experienced developers make most often.  This doesn't necessarily mean
it should turn into a FAQ sheet &#8212; it probably needs a more
coherent narrative structure than FAQs can offer.  But it should
follow the same reality-based principle of addressing the issues that
actually arise, rather than those you anticipate might arise.</p><p>If the project is a benevolent dictatorship, or has officers
endowed with special powers (president, chair, whatever), then the
document is also a good opportunity to codify succession procedures.
Sometimes this can be as simple as naming specific people as
replacements in case the BD suddenly leaves the project for any
reason.  Generally, if there is a BD, only the BD can get away with
naming a successor.  If there are elected officers, then the
nomination and election procedure that was used to choose them in the
first place should be described in the document.  If there was no
procedure originally, then get consensus on a procedure on the mailing
lists <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> writing about it.  People can
sometimes be touchy about hierarchical structures, so the subject
needs to be approached with sensitivity.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing is to make it clear that the
rules can be reconsidered.  If the conventions described in the
document start to hamper the project, remind everyone that it is
supposed to be a living reflection of the group's intentions, not a
source of frustration and blockage.  If someone makes a habit of
inappropriately asking for rules to be reconsidered every time the
rules get in her way, you don't always need to debate it with
her &#8212; sometimes silence is the best tactic.  If other people
agree with the complaints, they'll chime in, and it will be obvious
that something needs to change.  If no one else agrees, then the
person won't get much response, and the rules will stay as they
are.</p><p>Three good examples of project guidelines are the LibreOffice
Development guide at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development" target="_top">https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development</a>, the Subversion
Community Guide, at <a class="ulink" href="https://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/" target="_top">https://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</a>, and the
Apache Software Foundation governance documents, at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html" target="_top">https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html</a> and <a class="ulink" href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html" target="_top">https://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html</a>.  The ASF is
really a collection of software projects, legally organized as a
nonprofit corporation, so its documents tend to describe governance
procedures more than development conventions.  They're still worth
reading, though, because they represent the accumulated experience of
a lot of open source projects.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="consensus-democracy.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="social-infrastructure.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="non-profit.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Consensus-based Democracy </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Joining or Creating a Non-Profit Organization</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
