funded.  The items in this list aren't mutually exclusive; often a
project's financial backing will result from several, or even all, of
these motivations:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Sharing the burden</span></dt><dd><p>Separate organizations with related software needs often
     find themselves duplicating effort, either by redundantly writing
     similar code in-house, or by purchasing similar products from
     proprietary vendors.  When they realize what's going on, the
     organizations may pool their resources and create (or join) an
     open source project tailored to their needs.  The advantages are
     obvious: the costs of development are divided, but the benefits
     accrue to all.  Although this scenario seems most intuitive for
     nonprofits, it can make strategic sense even for for-profit
     competitors.</p><p>Examples: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openadapter.org/" target="_top">openadapter.org</a>,
     <a class="ulink" href="http://www.koha.org/" target="_top">koha.org</a></p></dd><dt><span class="term">Augmenting services</span></dt><dd><p>When a company sells services which depend on, or are made
     more attractive by, particular open source programs, it is
     naturally in that company's interests to ensure those programs
     are actively maintained.</p><p>Example: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_top">CollabNet's</a> support of
     <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_top">Subversion</a>
     (disclaimer: I worked for CollabNet on that project, but it's
     also a perfect example of this model).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Supporting hardware sales</span></dt><dd><p>The value of computers and computer components is directly
     related to the amount of software available for them.  Hardware
     vendors&#8212;not just whole-machine vendors, but also makers
     of peripheral devices and microchips&#8212;have found that
     having high-quality free software to run on their hardware is
     important to customers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Undermining a competitor</span></dt><dd><p>Sometimes companies support a particular open source
     project as a means of undermining a competitor's product, which
     may or may not be open source itself.  Eating away at a
     competitor's market share is usually not the sole reason for
     getting involved with an open source project, but it can be a
     factor.</p><p>Example: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_top">openoffice.org</a> (this is a historical example now, since
     Sun Microsystems, which started the OpenOffice project, has been
     bought by Oracle, and as a result most of the developer momentum
     has moved from OpenOffice to its offspring LibreOffice.  Although
     undermining a competitor wasn't the only reason Sun started
     OpenOffice, it was at least partly a response to Microsoft
     Office, and LibreOffice today continues to be a strong competitor
     to MS Office).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Marketing</span></dt><dd><p>Having your company associated with a popular open source
     application can be simply good brand management.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Dual-licensing</span></dt><dd><p><em class="firstterm">Dual-licensing</em> is the practice of
           offering software under a traditional proprietary license
           for customers who want to resell it as part of a
           proprietary application of their own, and simultaneously
           under a free license for those willing to use it under open
           source terms (see
           <a class="xref" href="dual-licensing.html" title="Dual Licensing Schemes">the section called &#8220;Dual Licensing Schemes&#8221;</a><span> in
           <a class="xref" href="legal.html" title="Chapter 10. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Chapter 10, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a></span>).
           If the open source developer community is active, the
           software gets the benefits of wide-area debugging and
           development, yet the company still gets a royalty stream to
           support some full-time programmers.</p><p>Two well-known examples are <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_top">MySQL</a>, makers of the
           database software of the same name, and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sleepycat.com/" target="_top">Sleepycat</a>, which
           offers distributions and support for the Berkeley Database.
           It's no coincidence that they're both database companies.
           Database software tends to be integrated into applications
           rather than marketed directly to users, so it's very
           well-suited to the dual-licensing model.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Donations</span></dt><dd><p>A widely-used project can sometimes get significant
           contributions, from both individuals and organizations,
           just by having an online donation button, or sometimes by
           selling branded merchandise such as coffee mugs, T-shirts,
           mousepads, etc.  A word of caution: if your project accepts
           donations, plan out how the money will be used
           <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> it comes in, and state the
           plans on the project's web site.  Discussions about how to
           allocate money tend to go a lot more smoothly when held
           before there's actual money to spend; and anyway, if there
           are significant disagreements, it's better to find that out
           while it's still academic.</p></dd></dl></div><p>A funder's business model is not the only factor in how it
relates to an open source community.  The historical relationship
between the two also matters: did the company start the project, or is
it joining an existing development effort?  In both cases, the funder
will have to earn credibility, but, not surprisingly, there's a bit
more earning to be done in the latter case.  The organization needs to
have clear goals with respect to the project.  Is the company trying
to keep a position of leadership, or simply trying to be one voice in
the community, to guide but not necessarily govern the project's
direction?  Or does it just want to have a couple of committers
around, able to fix customers' bugs and get the changes into the
public distribution without any fuss?</p><p>Keep these questions in mind as you read the guidelines that
follow.  They are meant to apply to any sort of organizational
involvement in a free software project, but every project is a human
environment, and therefore no two are exactly alike.  To some degree,
you will always have to play by ear, but following these principles
will increase the likelihood of things turning out the way you
want.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="money.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="money.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="long-term-developers.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 5. Money </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Hire for the Long Term</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
