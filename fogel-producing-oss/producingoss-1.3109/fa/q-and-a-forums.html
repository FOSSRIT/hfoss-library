<em class="firstterm">Q&amp;A forums</em>) have gone from being an
afterthought offered by the occasional project to an increasingly
expected and normal component of user-facing services.  A high-quality
Q&amp;A forum is like a FAQ with nearly real-time
updates &#8212; indeed, if your Q&amp;A forum is
sufficiently healthy, it often makes sense to either use it directly
as your project's FAQ, or have the FAQ consist mostly of pointers to
the forum's most popular items.</p><p>A project can certainly host its own forums, and many do, using
free software such as <a class="ulink" href="http://askbot.com" target="_top">Askbot</a>,
<a class="ulink" href="http://osqa.net" target="_top">OSQA</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://shapado.com/" target="_top">Shapado</a>, or <a class="ulink" href="http://www.coordino.com/" target="_top">Coordino</a>.  However, there are
also some third-party services that aggregate questions and answers,
the best-known of which, <a class="ulink" href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_top">stackoverflow.com</a>, frequently has its answers coming up first
in generic search engine results for popular questions.</p><p>While Stack Overflow hosts Q&amp;A about many things, not just
about open source projects, it seems to have found the right
combination of cultural guidelines and upvoting/downvoting features to
enable its contributors to quickly narrow in on good answers for
questions about open source software in particular.  (The questions
and answers on Stack Overflow are freely licensed, although the code
that runs the site itself is not open source.)  On the other hand,
projects that host their own Q&amp;A forums are lately doing pretty
well in search engine results too.  It may be that the current
dominance of Stack Overflow, as of this writing in 2014, is partly
just an accident of timing, and that the real lesson is that
Q&amp;A-style forums are an important addition to the free software
project communications toolbox &#8212; one that scales
better with user base than many other tools do.</p><p>There is no definite answer to the question of whether or when
you should set up dedicated Q&amp;A forums for your project.  It
depends on available resources, on the type of project, the
demographics of the user community, etc.  But do keep an eye out for
Stack Overflow results, or other third-party results, coming up in
generic question-style searches about your project. Their presence may
indicate that it's time to consider setting up a dedicated Q&amp;A
forum.  Whether you do or not, the project can still learn a lot from
looking at what people are asking on Stack Overflow, and at the
responses.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="right"><a accesskey="p" href="wikis.html">&#1602;&#1576;&#1604;&#1740;</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="technical-infrastructure.html">&#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;</a></td><td width="40%" align="left"> <a accesskey="n" href="social-networking.html">&#1576;&#1593;&#1583;&#1740;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">Wikis </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">&#1582;&#1575;&#1606;&#1607;</a></td><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top"> Social Networking Services</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
