any others.  Note "non-profit" vs "not-for-profit".  Mention Kuali et
al as models.  Problems of consortiums.  Don't assume the U.S. tax
code benefit is familiar everywhere.  Emphasize clear separation
between the legal infrastructure and the day-to-day running of the
project: the organization is there to take care of the things the
developers don't want to deal with, not to interfere with the things
the developers already know how to do.  Explain fiscal sponsorship
when talking about fundraising.  Note trademark ownership as well as
copyright ownership, and link to this section as appropriate from the
licensing/copyrights chapter and from the money / corporate
involvement chapter.  (See also other todo earlier in this chapter,
from 16 March 2014, about trademarks.)</em></span></p></div></body></html>
