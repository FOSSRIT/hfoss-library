Twitter is useful; Facebook appears not to be so relevant to open
source projects but check this with people who use it more.  Identi.ca
(if will persist).  Others?  Eventbrite (mention from
"meeting-in-person" section), what else?  Acknowledge that many of
these services are not open source; times have changed, the train has
left the barn or the horse has left the station or whatever.  One good
example: LibreOffice's "@AskLibreOffice" tweet stream at <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/AskLibreOffice">twitter.com/AskLibreOffice</a>.  See also <a class="ulink" href="http://ask.libreoffice.org/en/questions/">ask.libreoffice.org</a>
