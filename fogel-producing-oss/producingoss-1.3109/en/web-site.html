pages devoted to helping people participate in the project as
developers, documenters, etc.  Note that this may be different from the
main user-facing web site.  In many projects, users have different
needs and often (statistically speaking) a different mentality from
the developers.  The kinds of web pages most helpful to users are not
always the same as those helpful for developers.  Don't try to make a
"one size fits all" web site just to save some writing and maintenance
effort: you'll end up with a site that is not quite right for either
audience.</p><p>The two types of sites should cross-link, of course, and in
particular it's important that the user-oriented site have, tucked a
way in a corner somewhere, a clear link to the developers' site, since
most new developers will start out at the user-facing pages and look
for a path from there to the developers' area.</p><p>An example may make this clearer.  As of this writing in
January 2017, the office suite LibreOffice has its main user-oriented
web site at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_top">https://www.libreoffice.org/</a>, as you'd expect.  If you were a user wanting
to download and install LibreOffice, you'd start there, go straight to
the "Download" link, and so on.  But if you were a developer looking
to (say) fix a bug in LibreOffice, you might
<span class="emphasis"><em>start</em></span> at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_top">https://www.libreoffice.org/</a>, but you'd be looking for a link that says
something like "Developers", or "Development", or "Get
Involved" &#8212; in other words, you'd be looking for the
gateway to the development area.</p><p>In the case of LibreOffice, as with some other large projects,
they have a few different gateways to developer-land.  There's a
prominent link that says "Get Involved", and at the top there's also a
dropdown menu named "Community" that offers both "Get Involved" and
another link entitled "Developers" .</p><p>The "Get Involved" page is aimed at the broadest possible range of
potential contributors: developers, yes, but also documenters,
quality-assurance testers, marketing helpers, web infrastructure
experts, financial or in-kind donors, interface designers, support
forum helpers, etc.  This frees up the "Developers" page to target
the rather narrower audience of programmers who want to get involved
in improving the LibreOffice code.  The set of links and short
descriptions provided on both pages is admirably clear and concise:
you can tell immediately from looking whether you're in the right
place for what you want do, and if so what the next thing to click on
is.  The "Development" page gives some information about where to find
the code, how to contact the other developers, how to file bugs, and
things like that, but most importantly it points to what most seasoned
open source contributors would instantly recognize as the
<span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> gateway to actively-maintained development
information: the development wiki at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development" target="_top">https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development</a>.</p><p>This division into two contributor-facing gateways, one for all
kinds of contributions and another for coders specifically, is
probably right for a large, multi-faceted project like LibreOffice.
You'll have to use your judgement as to whether that kind of
subdivision is appropriate for your project; at least at the
beginning, it probably isn't.  It's better to start with one unified
contributor gateway, aimed at all the types of contributors you
expect, and if that page ever gets large enough or complex enough to
feel unwieldy &#8212; listen carefully for complaints about
it, since you and other long-time participants will be naturally
desensitized to weaknesses in introductory
pages! &#8212; then you can divide it up however seems
best.</p><p>From a technical point of view there is not much to say about
setting up the project web site.  Web hosting is a fairly easily
solved problem, and most of the important things to say about layout
and arrangement were covered in the previous chapter.  The web site's
main function is to present a clear and welcoming overview of the
project, and to bind together the various collaboration tools (the
version control system, bug tracker, etc.).  To save time and effort,
many projects just use one of the canned hosting services, as
described below.</p><div class="sect2" title="Canned Hosting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting"></a>Canned Hosting</h3></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">canned hosting</em> site is an online
service that offers some or all of the online collaboration tools
needed to run a free software project.  At a minimal, a canned hosting
site offers public version control repositories and bug tracking; most
also offer wiki space, many offer mailing list hosting too, and some
offer continuous integration testing and other
services<sup>[<a name="idp896" href="#ftn.idp896" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup>.  For many projects,
canned hosting provides a perfectly adequate developer-oriented entry
point to the project, and there is no need to set up a separate web
site.</p><p>There are two main advantages to using a canned site.  The first
is server capacity and bandwidth: their servers are hefty boxes
sitting on really fat pipes.  No matter how successful your project
gets, you're not going to run out of disk space or swamp the network
connection.  The second advantage is simplicity.  They have already
chosen a bug tracker, a version control system, perhaps discussion
forum software, and everything else you need to run a project.
They've configured the tools, arranged single-sign-on authentication
where appropriate, are taking care of backups for all the data stored
in the tools, etc.  You don't need to make many decisions.  All you
have to do is fill in a registration form, press a button, and
suddenly you've got a project development web site.</p><p>These are pretty significant benefits.  The disadvantage, of
course, is that you must accept <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> choices and
configurations, even if something different would be better for your
project.  Usually canned sites are adjustable within certain narrow
parameters, but you will never get the fine-grained control you would
have if you set up the site yourself and had full administrative
access to the server.</p><p>A perfect example of this is the handling of generated files.
Certain project web pages may be generated files &#8212; for example,
there are systems for keeping FAQ data in an easy-to-edit master
format, from which HTML, PDF, and other presentation formats can be
generated.  As explained in
<a class="xref" href="vc.html#version-everything" title="Version Everything">the section called &#8220;Version Everything&#8221;</a>,
you wouldn't want to version the generated formats, only the master
file.  But when your web site is hosted on someone else's server, it
may be difficult to set up a custom hook to regenerate the online
HTML version of the FAQ whenever the master file is changed.</p><p>If you choose a canned site, try to leave open the option of
switching to a different site later, by using a custom domain name as the
project's development home address.  You can forward that URL to the
canned site, or have a fully customized development home page at the
main URL and link to the canned site for specific functionality.  Just
try to arrange things such that if you later decide to use a different
hosting solution, the project's main address doesn't need to
change.</p><p>And if you're not sure whether to use canned hosting, then you
should probably use canned hosting.  These sites have integrated their
services in myriad ways (just one example: if a commit mentions a bug
ticket number using a certain format, then people browsing that commit
later will find that it automatically links to that ticket), ways that
would be laborious for you to reproduce, especially if it's your first
time running an open source project.  The universe of possible
configurations of collaboration tools is vast and complex, but the
same set of choices has faced everyone running an open source project
and there are some settled solutions now.  Each of the canned hosting
sites implements a reasonable subset of that solution space, and
unless you have reason to believe you can do better, your project will
probably run best just using one of those sites.</p><div class="sect3" title="Choosing a Canned Hosting Site"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting-choosing"></a>Choosing a Canned Hosting Site</h4></div></div></div><p>There are now so many sites providing free-of-charge canned
hosting for projects released under open source licenses that there is
not space here to review the field.</p><p>So I'll make this easy:</p><p>If you don't know what to choose, then choose GitHub (<a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/" target="_top">https://github.com/</a>).  It's by far the most
popular and appears set to stay that way for some years to come.  It
has a good set of features and integrations.  Many developers are
already familiar with GitHub and have an account there.  It offers
<a class="ulink" href="https://develop.github.com/" target="_top">https://develop.github.com/</a> for interacting
programmatically with project resources, and while it does not
currently offer mailing lists, there are plenty of other places you
can provision those, such as <a class="ulink" href="https://discourse.org/" target="_top">https://discourse.org/</a> and <a class="ulink" href="https://groups.google.com/" target="_top">https://groups.google.com/</a>.</p><p>If you're not convinced by GitHub (for example because your
project uses, say, Mercurial instead of Git for version control), but
you aren't sure where to host, take a look at Wikipedia's thorough
comparison at <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities</a>; it's
the first place to look for up-to-date, comprehensive information on
open source project hosting options.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Hosting on Fully Open Source Infrastructure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="hosting-on-freedom"></a>Hosting on Fully Open Source Infrastructure</h4></div></div></div><p>Although all the canned hosting sites use plenty of free
software in their stack, most of them also wrote some proprietary
code to glue it all together.  In these cases the hosting environment
itself is not fully open source, and thus cannot be easily reproduced
by others.  For example, while Git itself is free software, GitHub is
a hosted service running partly with proprietary
software &#8212; if you leave GitHub, you can't take a copy
of their infrastructure with you, at least not all of it.</p><p>Some projects would prefer a canned hosting site that runs an
entirely free software infrastructure and that could, in theory, be
reproduced independently were that ever to become necessary.
Fortunately, there are a few such sites.  As of mid-2015, <a class="ulink" href="https://phacility.com/" target="_top">https://phacility.com/</a> offers low-cost
project hosting in <a class="ulink" href="http://phabricator.org/" target="_top">http://phabricator.org/</a>, a fully open source web platform for open-source
style collaboration.</p><p>There is also GitLab (<a class="ulink" href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_top">https://gitlab.com/</a>), which until recently was fully open
source.  However, they now seem to offer an open source edition for
self-hosting and a so-called "enterprise edition"<sup>[<a name="idp925" href="#ftn.idp925" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup> that
they host and that has a few features the open source edition doesn't
have.  Unfortunately, GitLab.com doesn't currently seem to offer a
hosting package based on the strictly open source edition, which is
too bad, because that would be the best choice for an open source
project that wants to outsource hosting while preserving its
commitment, both philosophical and utilitarian, to software
freedom.</p><p>Furthermore, any service that offers hosting of the Redmine (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.redmine.org/" target="_top">http://www.redmine.org/</a>) or Trac (<a class="ulink" href="https://trac.edgewall.org/" target="_top">https://trac.edgewall.org/</a>) code collaboration
platforms effectively offers fully freedom-preserving project hosting,
because those platforms include most of the features needed to run an
open source project.  Some companies offer that kind of commercial
platform hosting with a zero-cost or very cheap rate for open source
projects.</p><p>Should you host your project on fully open source
infrastructure?  While it would be ideal, from the free software
philosophical perspective, to have access to all the code that runs
the site, I cannot say I've seen any evidence that hosting or not
hosting on that kind of site has any effect on a project's success.
The vast majority of developers who work on free software projects are
willing to participate through a non-free hosting platform when that's
what the project is using.</p><p>In my opinion, the crucial thing is to be able to interact with
project data in automatable ways, and to have a way to export the
data.  A site that meets these criteria can never truly lock you in,
and will even be somewhat extensible, via its programmatic interface.
While there is some value in having all the code that runs a hosting
site available under open source terms, in practice the demands of
actually deploying that code in a production environment are difficult
and sometimes prohibitive for most projects anyway.  The largest of
these sites need multiple servers, customized networks, and full-time
staffs to keep them running; merely having the code would not be
sufficient to duplicate or "fork" them anyway.  The main thing is just
to make sure your data isn't trapped.</p><p>Of course, all the above applies only to the servers of the
hosting site.  Your project itself should never require participants
to run proprietary collaboration software on their own
machines.<sup>[<a name="idp934" href="#ftn.idp934" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect3" title="Anonymity and Involvement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="anonymity"></a>Anonymity and Involvement</h4></div></div></div><p>A problem that is not strictly limited to the canned sites, but
is most often found there, is the over-requirement of user
registration to participate in various aspects of the project.  The
proper degree of requirement is a bit of a judgement call.  User
registration helps prevent spam, for one thing, and even if every
commit gets reviewed you still probably don't want anonymous strangers
pushing changes into your repository, for example.</p><p>But sometimes user registration ends up being required for tasks
that ought to be permitted to unregistered visitors, especially the
ability to file tickets in the bug tracker, and to comment on existing
tickets.  By requiring a logged-in username for such actions, the
project raises the involvement bar for what should be quick,
convenient tasks.  It also changes the demographics of who files bugs,
since those who take the trouble to set up a user account at the
project site are hardly a random sample even from among users who are
willing to file bugs (who in turn are already a biased subset of all
the project's users).  Of course, one wants to be able to contact
someone who's entered data into the ticket tracker, but having a field
where she can enter her email address (if she wants to) is sufficient.
If a new user spots a bug and wants to report it, she'll only be
annoyed at having to fill out an account creation form before she can
enter the bug into the tracker.  She may simply decide not to file the
bug at all.</p><p>If you have control over which actions can be done anonymously,
make sure that at least <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> read-only actions are
permitted to non-logged-in visitors, and if possible that data entry
portals, such as the bug tracker, that tend to bring information from
users to developers, can also be used anonymously, although of course
anti-spam techniques, such as captchas, may still be necessary.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp896" href="#idp896" class="para">28</a>] </sup>Note that for successful free software

question of whether such code is conceptually an extension of the
server, or should be thought of as running on the client machine even
though in some senses it has more access to server resources than to
client resources, is a deep and ongoing debate.  We won't settle it
here, but it's at least more complex than just which CPU is executing
the instructions.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="technical-infrastructure.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="technical-infrastructure.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="message-forums.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 3. Technical Infrastructure </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Mailing Lists / Message Forums</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
