feel the need for some sort of formal existence as a legal
entity — to be able to accept donations (see
<a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency">Chapter 5, <em>Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency</em></a> for discussion of how to handle incoming
funding), to purchase and maintain infrastructure for the project's
benefit, to organize conferences and developer meetups, to enforce
trademarks, etc.</p><p>There may be a few exceptional circumstances where forming your
own organization from scratch would be the right solution, but for
most projects it is much better to join an existing organization.
There are umbrella organizations whose purpose is to provide a legal
home for open source projects.  Working with multiple projects gives
these organizations economies of scale and broad
experience — any of them would almost certainly do a
better job of providing services to your project than your project
could manage if it started its own organization.</p><p>Here are some well-known and reputable umbrella organizations:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Software Freedom Conservancy <a class="ulink" href="https://sfconservancy.org/">https://sfconservancy.org/</a><sup>[<a id="idm1954" href="#ftn.idm1954" class="footnote">48</a>]</sup></li><li class="listitem">Apache Software Foundation <a class="ulink" href="https://apache.org/">https://apache.org/</a></li><li class="listitem">Eclipse Foundation <a class="ulink" href="https://eclipse.org/">https://eclipse.org/</a></li><li class="listitem">Software in the Public Interest <a class="ulink" href="http://spi-inc.org/">http://spi-inc.org/</a></li><li class="listitem">Linux Foundation <a class="ulink" href="http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org/">http://collabprojects.linuxfoundation.org/</a></li></ul></div><p>These are all based in the United States, but there are similar
umbrella organizations outside the U.S. — I just
didn't know them well enough to make recommendations.  If you're a
U.S. reader, remember that the distinctions the U.S. tax code makes
between different types of non-profit corporations, such as 501(c)(3)
tax-exempt organizations vs 501(c)(6) trade associations, may not be
meaningful to members of your project outside the U.S., and that the
tax benefits available to donors under 501(c)(3) won't apply to
non-U.S. donors anyway.</p><p>If your project joins or creats a non-profit organization, make
clear the separation between the legal infrastructure and the
day-to-day running of the project.  The organization is there to
handle things the developers don't want to handle, not to interfere
with the things the developers <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> want to handle
and are already competent to handle.  Even if the non-profit becomes
the official owner of the project's copyrights, trademarks, and other
assets, that shouldn't change the way decisions are made about
technical questions, project direction, etc.  One of the reasons to
join one of the existing organizations is that they already have
experience with this distinction, and know how to fairly read the will
of the project even when there is controversy or strong disagreement.
They also serve as a neutral place for resolving disagreements about
how to allocate the project's money or other resources.  More than one
of the organizations above has had to play "project psychotherapist"
on occasion, and their ability to do so should be considered an
advantage even by a healthy and smoothly functioning project.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm1954" href="#idm1954" class="para">48</a>] </sup>I think the Software
  Freedom Conservancy is a good choice for most projects,
  which is why I listed it first.  But I should add the disclosure
  that I joined their Evaluation Committee, a volunteer committee that
  evaluates projects applying to become members of the Conservancy,
  while revising this book for its 2nd edition.  The recommendation of
  the Conservancy was already in the in-progress text before I joined
  the committee.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
