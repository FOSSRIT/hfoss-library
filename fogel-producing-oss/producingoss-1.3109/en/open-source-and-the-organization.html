first edition of this book was published, it's become clear to me that
there are special concerns that apply to organizations launching or 
participating in open source projects.  Organizations contain formal
management structures and informal social structures: both are
affected by engagement with open source projects, and both sometimes
need to be changed to better support open source activity by the
individuals within the organization.  In particular, government
agencies have special pitfalls to watch out for when working with open
source projects.</p><p>This section therefore examines organizational issues generally,
and some issues specific to government agencies, and offers some
advice about how to make organizational engagement with open source
more likely to succeed.  Many of these recommendations will be brief
and somewhat generalized, not because there isn't more depth to go
into, but because the specifics can vary so much from organization to
organization that exploring all the possibilities here would require
too much space.  Please treat these bits of advice as starting points,
not as complete recipes in themselves.</p><div class="sect2" title="Dispel Myths Within Your Organization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dispel-myths"></a>Dispel Myths Within Your Organization</h3></div></div></div><p>In organizations that have been producing or using proprietary
software for a long time, certain myths about open source software
sometimes circulate.  One traditional source of such myths is, of
course, sales representatives from vendors of proprietary systems.
But one can't attribute it all to them.  It's just as often the case
that someone had some bad experiences in an open source project, or
used open source in the past without ensuring proper support channels,
and since that was their first experience in an unfamiliar territory,
the entire territory is now tainted.</p><p>Below are some of the myths I've encountered most frequently.
First, the negative myths:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>If it's open, that means anyone can
   change our code.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Believe it or not, you need to be prepared to respond to
     this.  Sometimes people &#8212; particularly senior
     decision-makers who have limited technical
     experience &#8212; don't understand the difference
     between an upstream codebase allowing anyone to copy the code and
     modify the resultant copies, and someone modifying the
     <span class="emphasis"><em>particular instance that you deploy</em></span>.  The
     former is just the definition of open
     source, of course.  The latter would be a security vulnerability,
     if it happened, but it has nothing to do with the license on the
     code.  I mention this myth merely to prepare you for encountering
     it, because otherwise you might not expect that anyone could hold
     this particular misunderstanding.  Trust me, they
     <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span>, and you need to be ready to answer
     it.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Open source software is insecure,
   because anyone can see the code / change the code.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>These are so easy to answer that I won't give a detailed
     refutation here; again, I merely note it so you can be prepared
     for it.  If you find yourself having to explain why open source
     software is at least as secure as any other kind of software, if
     not more secure, you may wish to use the excellent resources
     provided by Dr. David A. Wheeler at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/#oss" target="_top">http://www.dwheeler.com/#oss</a>,
     and the arguments at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mil-oss.org/learn-more/security-model-misconceptions" target="_top">http://www.mil-oss.org/learn-more/security-model-misconceptions</a>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Open source comes with no
   support.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>There are plenty of companies that sell support for open
     source software, and they're not hard to find.  There are also
     wonderfully helpful unofficial support communities on the
     Internet for different open source packages, of course, but often
     what organizations are looking for is a phone number to call, or
     a support chat room, that has a guaranteed response time.  These
     are available, it's just that the source from which you
     procure the software may be unrelated to the source from which
     you procure the support.  The best way to respond to this myth is
     to ask specifically for what packages support is desired, and
     then show some sources of support available for
     them.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>If we open source this project, we'll
   have to spend a lot of time interacting with outside
   developers.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>You open source your code, not your time and attention.
     You are never under any obligation to respond at all to outside
     parties, let alone engage substantively with them.  You should
     only do so when engaging will benefit
     <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> &#8212; which it often will;
     after all, one of the key strengths of open source is that it
     enlarges the collective brain of your development team in direct
     proportion to how much they interact with other developers who
     become interested in the code.  But that engagement is always
     under your control and at your discretion.  If you don't want
     your team's attention going to bug reports or development
     questions from the outside, that's fine.  Just be up front about
     that in project announcements and in the documentation, so that
     others can take that into account before they put a lot of energy
     into trying to communicate with your developers, and so they can
     decide whether forking to create a more open community would make
     sense for them (indeed, sometimes it might even be to your
     advantage for them to do that).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>If we open source this project, then
   we'll have to release all our other stuff as open source
   too.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This myth usually results from a misunderstanding of
       copyleft licenses and the GNU General Public License (GPL) in
       particular.  I won't go into detail here; see <a class="xref" href="legal.html" title="Chapter 9. Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter 9, <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a> for a discussion of what the GPL actually
       stipulates.  After reading that chapter, especially
       <a class="xref" href="license-choosing.html#copyright-holder-is-special" title="The Copyright Holder Is Special, Even In Copyleft Licenses">the section called &#8220;The Copyright Holder Is Special, Even In Copyleft Licenses&#8221;</a>, you will be able
       to explain why this belief is incorrect.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Next, the positive myths:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Open source is cheaper.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Licensing costs are often not the largest cost with
     proprietary software; they are often outweight by training costs,
     installation and configuration costs, and other factors that make
     up the "total cost of ownership".  But all of those other costs
     are, on average, the same for open source software.  Don't make
     the mistake of pitching your organization on open source software
     on the grounds that it is cheaper.  At least in terms of the most
     easily quantified costs, it is not.  It is often cheaper in the
     long run, because it frees your organization from proprietary
     vendor lock-in (see <a class="xref" href="marketing.html#lock-in-vs-freedom" title="Open Source and Freedom from Vendor Lock-In">the section called &#8220;Open Source and Freedom from Vendor Lock-In&#8221;</a>),
     reduces training costs for new employees (because
     they arrive already familiar with the software), gives you
     greater ability to customize software to your needs, etc.  But
     these are long-term benefits, and they may not show up directly
     on a balance sheet unless you take steps to make your accounting
     reveal them.  In the short term, open source generally isn't
     cheaper than proprietary software, and shouldn't be pitched that
     way.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Developers will devote attention to
   this code just because we released it.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>People with little experience in open source sometimes
     assume that the mere act of releasing code to the public will
     result in a flurry of attention from other
     developers &#8212; questions, patches, high-quality
     code review, bug reports, etc.  But what actually happens, in
     most cases, is silence.  Most good developers are busy people,
     and they're not going to pay attention to your project until they
     have some reason to.  If your code is good and solves a real
     problem, you can expect word to travel to the right places
     eventually, and of course you can help that word along with
     tactically smart announcements and posts (see <a class="xref" href="publicity.html" title="Publicity">the section called &#8220;Publicity&#8221;</a>).  But until your code has
     had time to naturally accumulate credibility and mindshare, most
     people won't pay any attention, so you shouldn't expect that
     first release to be a big deal for anyone but you.</p><p>There is a situation in which this myth is not a myth.  A
     large organization with a reputation and a dedicated public
     relations team <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> create buzz around an
     initial open source release.  If you do this, then make sure not
     to squander that buzz: be ready to constructively engage the
     developer attention you attract right away.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Other companies / cities / whoever
   will pick up this software and start using it right
   away.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Adopting any software involves costs.  Indeed, merely
     <span class="emphasis"><em>evaluating</em></span> software involves costs.  So when
     you release a new open source project that you and your team are
     excited about, that doesn't necessarily mean other entities are
     going to pick it up right away and run with it.  Many of them may
     notice it, if you've done your announcement process well, but
     that just means they'll put it on their list of things to
     investigate based on organization-wide
     priorities &#8212; in other words, they'll take a
     closer look based on <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> schedule, not
     yours.  So don't expect a flood of early adopters.  You may get a
     few, and they should definitely be cultivated because they will
     provide the word-of-mouth that gets you more adopters.  But in
     general you're more likely to see a trickle of early adopters
     over the first year or so after your initial release, than to see
     a flood of them immediately when the release is
     made.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>We can casually copy open source code
   into our own code.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Open source licenses are still licenses, and they come with
     a few conditions.  Virtually all of them require attribution at
     the source level and inclusion of the license together with the
     covered code.  Some licenses, especially the copyleft licenses
     discussed in <a class="xref" href="license-aspects.html" title="Aspects of Licenses">the section called &#8220;Aspects of Licenses&#8221;</a>, cause the
     entire derivative work to be under the same open source license
     thus implying redistribution obligations that you may not want.
     Some have patent clauses that can affect your company in complex
     ways.<sup>[<a name="idp2328" href="#ftn.idp2328" class="footnote">58</a>]</sup>  For all these reasons,
     incorporating open source code into software that will be
     distributed under a different license &#8212; whether
     open source or proprietary &#8212; cannot be done
     casually.  Organizations that incorporate open source code into
     their products usually need a formal process for doing so, one
     that involves review by someone who understands the legal issues
     and the possible interactions between licenses.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Foster Pools of Expertise in Multiple Places"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="foster-expertise-diversity"></a>Foster Pools of Expertise in Multiple Places</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes organizations that are accustomed to procuring
proprietary software treat open source software as if it were
proprietary, in the sense that they assume there is exactly one
authoritative provider of expert support, and that therefore it is
necessary to have a commercial relationship with that provider.</p><p>That's not how open source works.  One of the great strengths of
open source is the availability of support from multiple, competing
providers.  It's perfectly fine, and often advisable, to have a
commercial relationship with just one of those sources, but you must
remember that support in open source is fundamentally a
<span class="emphasis"><em>marketplace</em></span>, not an add-on feature that just
happens to come with the software license, as is often the case with
proprietary software.  Actually, even proprietary software sometimes
has a competitive support marketplace &#8212; think for
example of the third-party support providers for Oracle databases and
Microsoft operating systems &#8212; but in open source these
marketplaces tend to be more fluid and not as dominated by single,
easily-recognizeable giants, because there isn't necessarily one
commercial outfit that automatically assumes a place at the top of
the hierarchy to sell gold-label support (e.g., as Oracle or Microsoft
themselves would be, in the example just given).</p><p>The goal of fostering independent pools of expertise
should even affect how you structure contracts to develop the software
in the first place.  If you hire a firm to develop new open source
software, have a few of your own programmers working alongside them if
possible, so that you accumulate some in-house expertise.  This is not
necessarily because you won't want to use the same firm for future
maintenance &#8212; they might be a great
choice &#8212; but just so that you'll have a better
bargaining position and not be locked in.  Essentially, the more people
<span class="emphasis"><em>in different organizations</em></span> who know the code, the
better position that code is in, and the better position you are in.
This is also one of the side benefits of holding hackathons, as
discussed in <a class="xref" href="funding-non-programming.html#fund-meetings" title="Sponsoring Conferences, Hackathons, and other Developer Meetings">the section called &#8220;Sponsoring Conferences, Hackathons, and other Developer Meetings&#8221;</a>.</p><p>If your organization does not have enough in-house technical
ability to participate in the development process directly alongside
your contractor, or at least to perform knowledgeable review, then I
strongly recommend finding a third-party to provide
<span class="emphasis"><em>independent</em></span> deployability and maintainability
review while the project is under way, as described in
<a class="xref" href="contracting.html#osivv" title="Open Source IV&amp;V">the section called &#8220;Open Source IV&amp;V&#8221;</a>.</p><div class="sect3" title="Establish Contact Early With Relevant Communities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="talk-to-relevant-communities-early"></a>Establish Contact Early With Relevant Communities</h4></div></div></div><p>Another way to foster independent sources of expertise is to
establish contact with potentially interested technical communities
early and often during development.  They're almost always out there.
For example, if you're developing software with geospatial
functionality, there is an open source geospatial community that
probably wants to hear about it; if you're developing software to
process financial data, or medical data, there are open source
<em class="firstterm">fintech</em> and medical data communities.</p><p>You may even have already announced your project to those people
when you began, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="announcing.html" title="Announcing">the section called &#8220;Announcing&#8221;</a>.  But
there's more you can do to create external reservoirs of knowledge.
When your project runs across a design issue that you suspect others
may have encountered before, it's fine to ask them how they handled
it, as long as you do your homework by first finding out what you can
from their code and documentation and then asking any remaining
questions.  You can also arrange small-scale contracts with developers
who are active in related projects, to serve two goals at once:
improving your project's quality while establishing mindshare in
places that may be strategically useful later.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Don't Let Publicity Events Drive Project Schedule"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="publicity-events-vs-project-events"></a>Don't Let Publicity Events Drive Project Schedule</h3></div></div></div><p>Although open source projects are amenable to software project
management techniques, in general if you have an active developer
community you do lose some control over the exact timing of events in
the life of the project, especially the scheduling of releases.  Or
rather, you can still have as much control as you want, but now there
are other things you can lose if you exercise that control
in the wrong way.  For example, if the release manager (see <a class="xref" href="stabilizing-a-release.html#release-manager" title="Release Manager">the section called &#8220;Release Manager&#8221;</a>) is someone from outside your
organization, and she's doing a good job, then if you try to force the
release to be on a certain precise date, you may cause her and many of
the developers participating in release-specific work to give up and
devote their attention to something else.  You'd gain fine-grained
control of the release schedule, but at the cost of lower quality
releases and the possible loss of some of your development
community.</p><p>This is just one example illustrating the general principle that
if you have publicity needs related to an open source project, you
generally shouldn't let those needs drive the project's schedule.  If you
arrange a press conference for the project reaching 1.0 and being
deployed live, but then the developers decide on an extra two weeks of
testing because of some last-minute bugs, you'll have some improvising
to do.  (This example is drawn from real life, by the way.)</p><p>There are two ways to achieve this independence, and they are
not mutually exclusive.  One way is to just let project events drive
publicity instead of the other way around, such as by preparing
release announcements ahead of time but being ready to publish them
based on when the release is actually done.  The other way is to
create publicity events that are not bound to development milestones,
but are rather associated with project-related things that
<span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> able to be scheduled,
such as conference appearances, hackathons, major deployments,
etc.</p><p>You might be tempted to try a third way: to bring the
development community into the scheduling process, so that through
consensus you are able schedule certain milestones accurately enough
to tie timed publicity to them.  While that may sound like a good
idea, in practice it rarely works.  An exception to this is if the
whole project is on board with doing time-based releases, as described
in <a class="xref" href="stabilizing-a-release.html#time-based-vs-feature-based" title="Time-Based Releases vs Feature-Based Releases">Time-Based Releases vs Feature-Based Releases</a>.  If the development community
as a whole shares that goal, then they will make the sacrifices
necessary to keep to the time-based cycle &#8212; but your
organization must also be willing to abide by that schedule, even if
it doesn't always align with business needs.</p><p>An open source development community's first priority is the
software itself, and making sure it meets the needs its participants
are working toward.  Of course the community wants releases and other
deadlines to be met with reasonable regularity, and every development
community makes tradeoffs for that.  But even with the best of
intentions among all parties, you can never guarantee how that
tradeoff will be decided in a particular case, when things get down to
the wire.  The outcome of a community's decision-making process cannot
be anticipated with perfect accuracy, by
definition &#8212; if it could, there would be no need for a
decision-making process.  So while it's fine to try to influence the
community's priorities in ways that work to your advantage, you should
avoid relying on that for scheduling purposes, because you won't
succeed at it every time.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Key Role of Middle Management"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="middle-management"></a>The Key Role of Middle Management</h3></div></div></div><p>If you intend to have long-term organizational engagement with
open source software projects, the people in your middle layer of
management will play a key role in determining whether you succeed or
fail.</p><p>Supervising programmers who spend part or all of their time on
open source projects is more complex than supervising programmers on
purely internal projects.  Many aspects of the developers' work and
schedule will be strongly influenced by external factors not under the
control of management, and in any case the developers' own desires may
not always perfectly line up with the employer's.  After all, each
developer now has two unrelated audiences to satisfy: her employer, as
embodied by her direct manager, and her colleagues in the open source
project, many of whom may work for other employers.</p><p>If a manager is not sufficiently sensitive to this dynamic, then
developers can start to feel as though they serve two conflicting
masters.  Sometimes this conflict is the result of poor planning, and
other times it is real and unavoidable.  Good management can prevent
the former situation from happening in the first place, and in the
latter situation, good management is essential for recognizing it and
addressing it in some way that gives the developer clarity and a way
to handle the conflicted situation.</p><p>Middle managers also have not only the usual upward and lateral
internal reporting responsibilities, but are to some degree
responsible for the image &#8212; the open source brand
identity &#8212; of the organization in the projects where
its developers participate.  This is a lot like having an entire extra
constituency to satisfy, and managers who have no experience with open
source participation themselves are unlikely to have a solid
understanding of how to position the organization and its developers
within the project.</p><p>Furthemore, the middle layer of management is often best
positioned to serve as a communications conduit and information filter
between the project (that is, the whole project including all its
other participants) and the company.  The wealth of information
available from the activity in an open source project is most useful
to the organization if there is a filtered channel by which the most
interesting activities can be communicated to the relevant
stakeholders within the organization &#8212; stakeholders
who might include other technical staff, executives, and sales team
members.  But both by their position and their temperament, the
programmers themselves are often not best suited to serve as this
conduit.  They may have a very deep understanding of the particular
projects they work on, but they often have a less complete view of the
organization's interests &#8212; for example, in a
commercial environment, the programmers often do not have a clear idea
of how the project fits into the company's various lines of business
or into its sales processes.  Middle managers are better positioned to
maintain the requisite bidirectional sensitivity: aware enough of the
project to ask the programmers for more information when necessary,
and aware enough of the organization to have a sense of what in the
project might be unexpectedly relevant to the organization.</p><p>Think carefully about who occupies the middle management
positions that serve as the interface between the organizations's
priorities and the open source project's development direction, and
provide them with extra training if necessary.  It is best if the
managers themselves have had direct experience as participants in some
open source project.  This doesn't have to be the same project as the
one for which they are now managing developers; the situations and
tensions that arise in open source projects tend to be similar, so
experience from one project will generally translate well to other
projects.  But a manager who has never dealt with open source projects
first-hand at all will start with limited ability to understand the
various pressures faced by the organization's developers operating in
open source environments, and limited ability to play the role of
communications conduit between the organization and the
project.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="InnerSourcing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="innersource"></a>InnerSourcing</h3></div></div></div><p><em class="firstterm">InnerSource</em> or
<em class="firstterm">innersourcing</em> means using standard open source
development practices only within the boundaries of an organization.
For example, a company might move all of its projects to GitHub
(albeit in private, not public, repositories), and declare that,
inside the company, any engineer can report bugs and contribute pull
requests to any project anywhere in the company.  Innersourcing also
often includes sincere efforts at internal cultural change: managers
encouraging developers to speak their mind on both technical and
process issues, developers being given more latitude to choose which
projects and teams they work with, etc.</p><p>In early 2016 I conducted interviews<sup>[<a name="idp2372" href="#ftn.idp2372" class="footnote">59</a>]</sup> with open source specialists
at a number of medium- and large-sized technology companies, many of
whom had observed innersourcing efforts and were willing to talk about
the results.  What they reported was pretty consistent from company to
company, and consistent with my own experience as a consultant:
innersourcing really <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> make a positive
difference, in several ways, but it's also definitely not the same as
true open source.</p><p>For companies that already participate in open source projects,
innersourcing can reduce the difference between internal development
practices and external ones.  If some of your engineers 
participate in upstream open source projects anyway, where they
must use typical open source collaboration tools and adhere to open
source standards for submitting and reviewing code and documentation,
then moving the company's internal engineering infrastructure and
conventions in that direction means less context-switching overhead
for existing staff, an easier onboarding process for new hires, and
sometimes improved technical compatibility between internal and
external projects.  (For these reasons, innersourcing is also often
used as the first "baby steps" toward genuine corporate participation
in open source projects.)</p><p>But the benefits of innersourcing go beyond that.  When
accompanied by a real commitment to reduce managerial and
organizational barriers to engineers participating in projects across
the company, innersourcing can improve morale, help spread expertise
around the company more effectively (because expertise will come
closer to flowing along its natural paths, rather than being directed
by management), and make software development more
efficient.<sup>[<a name="idp2377" href="#ftn.idp2377" class="footnote">60</a>]</sup></p><p>Nevertheless, innersource is not the same as open source, nor is
it even "open source lite".  The managers we talked to reported that
innersourced projects don't have the provocative, uncontrolled energy of truly
open source projects, because all the actors in innersourcing are,
ultimately, embedded in the same hierarchical authority structure.
Fundamentally, open source dynamics require at least the potential for
totally permissionless modification (i.e., you don't have to worry
what someone else might think of a fork).  When software only
circulates within a given management hierarchy, then that potential
for permissionless collaboration vanishes &#8212; and with
it, the potential for true open source behavior vanishes too.  The
permission structure that governs one's behavior with respect to the
code is not just a matter of the code's license: it's also about whom
you report to, what others in the hierarchy might think about your
changes, etc.</p><p>In the long run, the dynamics of open source collaboration
require an external supply of freedom.  There must always be people
who could, in principle, fork or do whatever they want without
worrying about consequences to the original authors' organization.
When that external freedom is removed, everything changes.</p><p>Innersourcing also fails the "portable résumé"
test &#8212; an employee can't take the code with her, and
her work will not be publicly visible (see <a class="xref" href="hiring.html" title="Hiring Open Source Developers">the section called &#8220;Hiring Open Source Developers&#8221;</a>).
She can be alienated from her work, if she leaves the company, which
means that her motivation to personally invest is reduced.</p><p>None of this means that innersourcing isn't worth it.  It can be
