from five years of working with the Subversion project (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/">http://subversion.apache.org/</a>).
Subversion is an open source
version control system, written from scratch, and intended to replace
CVS as the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> version control
system of choice in the open source community.  The project was
started by my employer, CollabNet (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/">http://www.collab.net/</a>), in early 2000,
and thank goodness
CollabNet understood right from the start how to run it as a truly
collaborative, distributed effort.  We got a lot of 
developer buy-in early on; today there are 50-some developers on the
project, of whom only a few are CollabNet employees.</p><p>Subversion is in many ways a classic example of an open source
project, and I ended up drawing on it more heavily than I originally
expected.  This was partly a matter of convenience: whenever I needed
an example of a particular phenomenon, I could usually call one up
from Subversion right off the top of my head.  But it was also a
matter of verification.  Although I am involved in other free software
projects to varying degrees, and talk to friends and acquaintances
involved in many more, one quickly realizes when writing for print
that all assertions need to be fact-checked.  I didn't want to make
statements about events in other projects based only on what I could
read in their public mailing list archives.  If someone were to try
that with Subversion, I knew, she'd be right about half the time and
wrong the other half.  So when drawing inspiration or examples from a
project with which I didn't have direct experience, I tried to first
talk to an informant there, someone I could trust to explain what was
really going on.</p><p>While Subversion was my full time job from 2000-2006, I've been
involved in free software for more than twenty years, including all
the years since 2006 (when the first edition of this book was
published).  Other projects and organizations that have influenced
this book include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The GNU Emacs text editor project at the Free
            Software Foundation, in which I maintain a few small
            packages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Concurrent Versions System (CVS), which I worked on
            intensely in 1994â€“1995 with Jim Blandy and was
            involved with intermittently for a few years afterwards.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The collection of open source projects known as the
            Apache Software Foundation, especially the Apache Portable
            Runtime (APR) and Apache HTTP Server.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Launchpad.net project at Canonical, Ltd.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Code for America and O'Reilly Media, which gave me
            an inside view on open source civic technology development
            starting in 2010, and kindly kept me in the loop after I
            became a full-time independent consultant in 2012.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The many open source anti-surveillance and
            censorship-circumvention tools supported by the Open
            Internet Tools Project (OpenITP.org) and by the Open
            Technology Institute at the New America Foundation.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Checkbook NYC, the municipal financial transparency

            application for inventorying and helping protect cultural

            and World Monuments Fund.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>OpenOffice.org / LibreOffice.org, the Berkeley
            Database from Sleepycat, and MySQL Database; I have not been

Many of the client
projects I work with through our consulting practice at Open Tech
Strategies, LLC have influenced this book, and like most open source
programmers, I keep loose tabs on a variety of different projects of
interest to me, just to have a sense of the general state of things.
I haven't named all of them here, but they are mentioned in the text
where appropriate.</p></div></body></html>
