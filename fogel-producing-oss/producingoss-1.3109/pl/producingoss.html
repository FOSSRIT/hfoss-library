ró&#380;nych powodów nie jest równie&#380; to&#380;same z prowadzeniem tradycyjnej
organizacji niedochodowej czy rz&#261;dowej. Prowadzenie projektów tego typu
ma wiele podobie&#324;stw do wszystkich tych rzeczy, ale stopniowo doszed&#322;em
do wniosku &#380;e wolne oprogramowanie jest <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">sui

sensownie porównywa&#263;, ale &#380;adna z nich nie jest z nim identyczna. W
rzeczy samej, nawet za&#322;o&#380;enie &#380;e projekt takiego typu mo&#380;na "prowadzi&#263;"

rozpraszanie si&#281; jednostek, z których ka&#380;da idzie w&#322;asn&#261; drog&#261;, ale
entuzjastyczna wspó&#322;praca. W rzeczy samej&#8212;umiej&#281;tno&#347;&#263; kooperacji jest

pi&#281;ciu lat pracy w projekcie Subversion (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>). Subversion to system kontroli

zaprojektowany jako nast&#281;pca CVS w roli <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de

ochotników wcze&#347;nie w to wesz&#322;o; obecnie w projekcie jest oko&#322;o 50

projektu open source i wspominam o nim o wiele cz&#281;&#347;ciej ni&#380; zak&#322;ada&#322;em

przyk&#322;adu danego zjawiska, to zwykle mog&#322;em si&#281; natychmiast odwo&#322;a&#263; do
Subversion. Ponadto by&#322;a to równie&#380; kwestia sprawdzalno&#347;ci. Mimo, &#380;e
by&#322;em w ró&#380;nym stopniu zaanga&#380;owany w inne projekty wolnego

metod&#261; w przypadku Subversion, to zapewne w po&#322;owie mia&#322;by racj&#281;, a w

packaging, figuring that these can always be done later, when the
project is well under way.  Presentation and packaging comprise a wide
range of tasks, all revolving around the theme of reducing the barrier
to entry.  Making the project inviting to the uninitiated means
writing user and developer documentation, setting up a project web
site that's informative to newcomers, automating as much of the
software's compilation and installation as possible, etc.  Many
programmers unfortunately treat this work as being of secondary
importance to the code itself.  There are a couple of reasons for
this.  First, it can feel like busywork, because its benefits are most
visible to those least familiar with the project, and vice versa.
After all, the people who develop the code don't really need the
packaging.  They already know how to install, administer, and use the
software, because they wrote it.  Second, the skills required to do
presentation and packaging well are often completely different from
those required to write code.  People tend to focus on what they're
good at, even if it might serve the project better to spend a little
time on something that suits them less.  <a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Rozdzia&#322; 2. Zaczynamy">Rozdzia&#322; 2, <i>Zaczynamy</i></a> discusses presentation and packaging
in detail, and explains why it's crucial that they be a priority from
the very start of the project.</p><p>Next comes the fallacy that little or no project management is
required in open source, or conversely, that the same management
practices used for in-house development will work equally well on an
open source project.  Management in an open source project isn't
always very visible, but in the successful projects, it's usually
happening behind the scenes in some form or another.  A small thought
experiment suffices to show why.  An open source project consists of a
random collection of programmers&#8212;already a notoriously
independent-minded category&#8212;who have most likely never met each
other, and who may each have different personal goals in working on
the project.  The thought experiment is simply to imagine what would
happen to such a group <span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> management.
Barring miracles, it would collapse or drift apart very quickly.
Things won't simply run themselves, much as we might wish otherwise.
But the management, though it may be quite active, is often informal,
subtle, and low-key.  The only thing keeping a development group
together is their shared belief that they can do more in concert than
individually.  Thus the goal of management is mostly to ensure that
they continue to believe this, by setting standards for
communications, by making sure useful developers don't get
marginalized due to personal idiosyncracies, and in general by making
the project a place developers want to keep coming back to.  Specific
techniques for doing this are discussed throughout the rest of this
book.</p><p>Finally, there is a general category of problems that may be
called "failures of cultural navigation."  Ten years ago, even five,
it would have been premature to talk about a global culture of free
software, but not anymore.  A recognizable culture has slowly emerged,
and while it is certainly not monolithic&#8212;it is at least as prone
to internal dissent and factionalism as any geographically bound
culture&#8212;it does have a basically consistent core.  Most
successful open source projects exhibit some or all of the
characteristics of this core.  They reward certain types of behaviors,
and punish others; they create an atmosphere that encourages unplanned
participation, sometimes at the expense of central coordination; they
have concepts of rudeness and politeness that can differ substantially
from those prevalent elsewhere.  Most importantly, longtime
participants have generally internalized these standards, so that they
share a rough consensus about expected conduct.  Unsuccessful projects
usually deviate in significant ways from this core, albeit
unintentionally, and often do not have a consensus about what
constitutes reasonable default behavior.  This means that when
problems arise, the situation can quickly deteriorate, as the
participants lack an already established stock of cultural reflexes to
fall back on for resolving differences. </p><p>This book is a practical guide, not an anthropological study or
a history.  However, a working knowledge of the origins of today's
free software culture is an essential foundation for any practical
advice.  A person who understands the culture can travel far and wide
in the open source world, encountering many local variations in custom
and dialect, yet still be able to participate comfortably and
effectively everywhere.  In contrast, a person who does not understand
the culture will find the process of organizing or participating in a
project difficult and full of surprises.  Since the number of people
developing free software is still growing by leaps and bounds, there
are many people in that latter category&#8212;this is largely a
culture of recent immigrants, and will continue to be so for some
time.  If you think you might be one of them, the next section
provides background for discussions you'll encounter later, both in
this book and on the Internet.  (On the other hand, if you've been
working with open source for a while, you may already know a lot of
its history, so feel free to skip the next section.)</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Historia"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="history"></a>Historia</h2></div></div></div><p>Udost&#281;pniania oprogramowania ma tak d&#322;ug&#261; histori&#281; jak samo

them and their colleagues.  It was therefore in the manufacturer's
interests for machine-specific code and knowledge to spread as widely
as possible.)</p><p>Although this early period resembled today's free software
culture in many ways, it differed in two crucial respects.  First,
there was as yet little standardization of hardware&#8212;it was a
time of flourishing innovation in computer design, but the diversity
of computing architectures meant that everything was incompatible with
everything else.  Thus, software written for one machine would
generally not work on another.  Programmers tended to acquire
expertise in a particular architecture or family of architectures
(whereas today they would be more likely to acquire expertise in a
programming language or family of languages, confident that their
expertise will be transferable to whatever computing hardware they
happen to find themselves working with).  Because a person's expertise
tended to be specific to one kind of computer, their accumulation of
expertise had the effect of making that computer more attractive to
them and their colleagues.  It was therefore in the manufacturer's
interests for machine-specific code and knowledge to spread as widely
as possible.</p><p>Second, there was no Internet.  Though there were fewer legal
restrictions on sharing than today, there were more technical ones:
the means of getting data from place to place were inconvenient and
cumbersome, relatively speaking.  There were some small, local
networks, good for sharing information among employees at the same
research lab or company.  But there remained barriers to overcome if
one wanted to share with everyone, no matter where they were.  These
barriers <span class="emphasis"><em>were</em></span> overcome in many cases.  Sometimes
different groups made contact with each other independently, sending
disks or tapes through land mail, and sometimes the manufacturers
themselves served as central clearing houses for patches.  It also
helped that many of the early computer developers worked at
universities, where publishing one's knowledge was expected.  But the
physical realities of data transmission meant there was always an
impedance to sharing, an impedance proportional to the distance (real
or organizational) that the software had to travel.  Widespread,
frictionless sharing, as we know it today, was not possible.</p><div class="sect2" title="The Rise of Proprietary Software and Free Software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="propertization"></a>The Rise of Proprietary Software and Free Software</h3></div></div></div><p>As the industry matured, several interrelated changes occurred
simultaneously.  The wild diversity of hardware designs gradually gave
way to a few clear winners&#8212;winners through superior technology,
superior marketing, or some combination of the two.  At the same time,
and not entirely coincidentally, the development of so-called "high
level" programming languages meant that one could write a program
once, in one language, and have it automatically translated
("compiled") to run on different kinds of computers.  The implications
of this were not lost on the hardware manufacturers: a customer could
now undertake a major software engineering effort without necessarily
locking themselves into one particular computer architecture.  When
this was combined with the gradual narrowing of performance
differences between various computers, as the less efficient designs
were weeded out, a manufacturer that treated its hardware as its only
asset could look forward to a future of declining profit margins.  Raw
computing power was becoming a fungible good, while software was
becoming the differentiator.  Selling software, or at least treating
it as an integral part of hardware sales, began to look like a good
strategy.</p><p>This meant that manufacturers had to start enforcing the
copyrights on their code more strictly.  If users simply continued to
share and modify code freely among themselves, they might
independently reimplement some of the improvements now being sold as
"added value" by the supplier.  Worse, shared code could get into the
hands of competitors.  The irony is that all this was happening around
the time the Internet was getting off the ground.  Just when truly
unobstructed software sharing was finally becoming technically
possible, changes in the computer business made it economically
undesirable, at least from the point of view of any single company.
The suppliers clamped down, either denying users access to the code
that ran their machines, or insisting on non-disclosure agreements
that made effective sharing impossible.</p><div class="sect3" title="Conscious resistance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="history-conscious-resistance"></a>Conscious resistance</h4></div></div></div><p>As the world of unrestricted code swapping slowly faded away, a
counterreaction crystallized in the mind of at least one programmer.
Richard Stallman worked in the Artificial Intelligence Lab at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1970s and early '80s,
during what turned out to be a golden age and a golden location for
code sharing.  The AI Lab had a strong "hacker
ethic",<sup>[<a name="idp5004928" href="#ftn.idp5004928" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup> and people were not only encouraged but
expected to share whatever improvements they made to the system.  As
Stallman wrote later:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We did not call our software "free software",
      because that term did not yet exist; but that is what it was.
      Whenever people from another university or a company wanted to
      port and use a program, we gladly let them.  If you saw someone
      using an unfamiliar and interesting program, you could always
      ask to see the source code, so that you could read it, change
      it, or cannibalize parts of it to make a new program.
      </em></span></p><p>(from <span class="bold"><strong><a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/gnu/thegnuproject.html</a></strong></span>)</p></blockquote></div><p>This Edenic community collapsed around Stallman shortly after
1980, when the changes that had been happening in the rest of the
industry finally caught up with the AI Lab.  A startup company hired
away many of the Lab's programmers to work on an operating system
similar to what they had been working on at the Lab, only now under an
exclusive license.  At the same time, the AI Lab acquired new
equipment that came with a proprietary operating system.</p><p>Stallman saw the larger pattern in what was happening:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The modern computers of the era, such as the VAX
      or the 68020, had their own operating systems, but none of them
      were free software: you had to sign a nondisclosure agreement
      even to get an executable copy.</em></span> </p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This meant that the first step in using a
      computer was to promise not to help your neighbor. A cooperating
      community was forbidden. The rule made by the owners of
      proprietary software was, "If you share with your neighbor, you
      are a pirate. If you want any changes, beg us to make them."
      </em></span> </p></blockquote></div><p>By some quirk of personality, he decided to resist the trend.
Instead of continuing to work at the now-decimated AI Lab, or taking a
job writing code at one of the new companies, where the results of his
work would be kept locked in a box, he resigned from the Lab and
started the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation (FSF).  The
goal of GNU<sup>[<a name="idp5012608" href="#ftn.idp5012608" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup> was to develop a completely free and open
computer operating system and body of application software, in which
users would never be prevented from hacking or from sharing their
modifications.  He was, in essence, setting out to recreate what had
been destroyed at the AI Lab, but on a world-wide scale and without
the vulnerabilities that had made the AI Lab's culture susceptible to
disintegration.</p><p>In addition to working on the new operating system, Stallman
devised a copyright license whose terms guaranteed that his code would
be perpetually free.  The GNU General Public License (GPL) is a clever
piece of legal judo: it says that the code may be copied and modified
without restriction, and that both copies and derivative works (i.e.,
modified versions) must be distributed under the same license as the
original, with no additional restrictions.  In effect, it uses
copyright law to achieve an effect opposite to that of traditional
copyright: instead of limiting the software's distribution, it
prevents <span class="emphasis"><em>anyone</em></span>, even the author, from limiting
it.  For Stallman, this was better than simply putting his code into
the public domain.  If it were in the public domain, any particular
copy of it could be incorporated into a proprietary program (as has
also been known to happen to code under permissive copyright
licenses).  While such incorporation wouldn't in any way diminish the
original code's continued availability, it would have meant that
Stallman's efforts could benefit the enemy&#8212;proprietary software.
The GPL can be thought of as a form of protectionism for free
software, because it prevents non-free software from taking full
advantage of GPLed code.  The GPL and its relationship to other free
software licenses are discussed in detail in
<a class="xref" href="#legal" title="Rozdzia&#322; 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Rozdzia&#322; 9, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a>.</p><p>With the help of many programmers, some of whom shared
Stallman's ideology and some of whom simply wanted to see a lot of
free code available, the GNU Project began releasing free replacements
for many of the most critical components of an operating system.
Because of the now-widespread standardization in computer hardware and
software, it was possible to use the GNU replacements on otherwise
non-free systems, and many people did.  The GNU text editor (Emacs)
and C compiler (GCC) were particularly successful, gaining large and
loyal followings not on ideological grounds, but simply on their
technical merits.  By about 1990, GNU had produced most of a free
operating system, except for the kernel&#8212;the part that the
machine actually boots up, and that is responsible for managing memory,
disk, and other system resources.</p><p>Unfortunately, the GNU project had chosen a kernel design that
turned out to be harder to implement than expected.  The ensuing delay
prevented the Free Software Foundation from making the first release
of an entirely free operating system.  The final piece was put into
place instead by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish computer science student
who, with the help of volunteers around the world, had completed a
free kernel using a more conservative design.  He named it Linux, and
when it was combined with the existing GNU programs, the result was a
completely free operating system.  For the first time, you could boot
up your computer and do work without using any proprietary
software.<sup>[<a name="idp5017184" href="#ftn.idp5017184" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup></p><p>Much of the software on this new operating system was not
produced by the GNU project.  In fact, GNU wasn't even the only group
working on producing a free operating system (for example, the code
that eventually became NetBSD and FreeBSD was already under
development by this time).  The importance of the Free Software
Foundation was not only in the code they wrote, but in their political
rhetoric.  By talking about free software as a cause instead of a
convenience, they made it difficult for
programmers <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have a political consciousness
about it.  Even those who disagreed with the FSF had to engage the
issue, if only to stake out a different position.  The FSF's
effectiveness as propagandists lay in tying their code to a message,
by means of the GPL and other texts.  As their code spread widely,
that message spread as well.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Accidental resistance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="history-accidental-resistance"></a>Accidental resistance</h4></div></div></div><p>There were many other things going on in the nascent free
software scene, however, and few were as explictly ideological as
Stallman's GNU Project.  One of the most important was
the <em class="firstterm">Berkeley Software Distribution</em>
(<em class="firstterm">BSD</em>), a gradual re-implementation of the Unix
operating system&#8212;which up until the late 1970's had been a
loosely proprietary research project at AT&amp;T&#8212;by programmers
at the University of California at Berkeley.  The BSD group did not
make any overt political statements about the need for programmers to
band together and share with one another, but they
<span class="emphasis"><em>practiced</em></span> the idea with flair and
enthusiasm, by coordinating a massive distributed development effort
in which the Unix command-line utilities and code libraries, and
eventually the operating system kernel itself, were rewritten from
scratch mostly by volunteers.  The BSD project became a prime example
of non-ideological free software development, and also served as a
training ground for many developers who would go on to remain active
in the open source world.</p><p>Another crucible of cooperative development was the <em class="firstterm">X
Window System</em>, a free, network-transparent graphical
computing environment, developed at MIT in the mid-1980's in
partnership with hardware vendors who had a common interest in being
able to offer their customers a windowing system.  Far from opposing
proprietary software, the X license deliberately allowed proprietary
extensions on top of the free core&#8212;each member of the consortium
wanted the chance to enhance the default X distribution, and thereby
gain a competitive advantage over the other members.  X
Windows<sup>[<a name="idp5017648" href="#ftn.idp5017648" class="footnote">6</a>]</sup> itself was free
software, but mainly as a way to level the playing field between
competing business interests, not out of some desire to end the
dominance of proprietary software.  Yet another example, predating the
GNU project by a few years, was TeX, Donald Knuth's free,
publishing-quality typesetting system.  He released it under a license
that allowed anyone to modify and distribute the code, but not to call
the result "TeX" unless it passed a very strict set of compatibility
tests (this is an example of the "trademark-protecting" class of free
licenses, discussed more in <a class="xref" href="#legal" title="Rozdzia&#322; 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Rozdzia&#322; 9, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a>).  Knuth wasn't
taking a stand one way or the other on the question of
free-versus-proprietary software, he just needed a better typesetting
system in order to complete his
<span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span> goal&#8212;a book on computer
programming&#8212;and saw no reason not to release his system to the
world when done.</p></div><p>Without listing every project and every license, it's safe to
say that by the late 1980's, there was a lot of free software
available under a wide variety of licenses.  The diversity of licenses
reflected a corresponding diversity of motivations.  Even some of the
progammers who chose the GNU GPL were much less ideologically driven
than the GNU project itself.  Although they enjoyed working on free
software, many developers did not consider proprietary software a
social evil.  There were people who felt a moral impulse to rid the
world of "software hoarding" (Stallman's term for non-free software),
but others were motivated more by technical excitement, or by the
pleasure of working with like-minded collaborators, or even by a
simple human desire for glory.  Yet by and large these disparate
motivations did not interact in destructive ways.  This is partly
because software, unlike other creative forms like prose or the visual
arts, must pass semi-objective tests in order to be considered
successful: it must run, and be reasonably free of bugs.  This gives
all participants in a project a kind of automatic common ground, a
reason and a framework for working together without worrying too much
about qualifications beyond the technical.</p><p>Developers had another reason to stick together as well: it
turned out that the free software world was producing some very
high-quality code.  In some cases, it was demonstrably technically
superior to the nearest non-free alternative; in others, it was at
least comparable, and of course it always cost less.  While only a few
people might have been motivated to run free software on strictly
philosophical grounds, a great many people were happy to run it
because it did a better job.  And of those who used it, some
percentage were always willing to donate their time and skills to help
maintain and improve the software.</p><p>This tendency to produce good code was certainly not universal,
but it was happening with increasing frequency in free software
projects around the world.  Businesses that depended heavily on
software gradually began to take notice.  Many of them discovered that
they were already using free software in day-to-day operations, and
simply hadn't known it (upper management isn't always aware of
everything the IT department does).  Corporations began to take a more
active and public role in free software projects, contributing time
and equipment, and sometimes even directly funding the development of
free programs.  Such investments could, in the best scenarios, repay
themselves many times over.  The sponsor only pays a small number of
expert programmers to devote themselves to the project full time, but
reaps the benefits of <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone's</em></span> contributions,
including work from unpaid volunteers and from programmers being paid
by other corporations.</p></div><div class="sect2" title='"Free" Versus "Open Source"'><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="free-vs-open-source"></a>"Free" Versus "Open Source"</h3></div></div></div><p>As the corporate world gave more and more attention to free
software, programmers were faced with new issues of presentation.  One
was the word "free" itself.  On first hearing the term "free software"
many people mistakenly think it means just "zero-cost software."  It's
true that all free software is zero-cost,<sup>[<a name="idp5036576" href="#ftn.idp5036576" class="footnote">7</a>]</sup>
but not all zero-cost software is free.  For example, during the
battle of the browsers in the 1990s, both Netscape and Microsoft gave
away their competing web browsers at no charge, in a scramble to gain
market share.  Neither browser was free in the "free software" sense.
You couldn't get the source code, and even if you could, you didn't
have the right to modify or redistribute it.<sup>[<a name="idp5037696" href="#ftn.idp5037696" class="footnote">8</a>]</sup>  The only thing
you could do was download an executable and run it.  The browsers were
no more free than shrink-wrapped software bought in a store; they
merely had a lower price.</p><p>This confusion over the word "free" is due entirely to an
unfortunate ambiguity in the English language.  Most other tongues
distinguish low prices from liberty (the distinction between
<span class="emphasis"><em>gratis</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>libre</em></span> is
immediately clear to speakers of Romance languages, for example).  But
English's position as the de facto bridge language of the Internet
means that a problem with English is, to some degree, a problem for
everyone.  The misunderstanding around the word "free" was so
prevalent that free software programmers eventually evolved a standard
formula in response: "It's <span class="emphasis"><em>free</em></span> as in
<span class="emphasis"><em>freedom</em></span>&#8212;think <span class="emphasis"><em>free
speech</em></span>, not <span class="emphasis"><em>free beer</em></span>."  Still, having
to explain it over and over is tiring.  Many programmers felt, with
some justification, that the ambiguous word "free" was hampering the
public's understanding of this software.</p><p>But the problem went deeper than that.  The word "free" carried
with it an inescapable moral connotation: if freedom was an end in
itself, it didn't matter whether free software also happened to
be better, or more profitable for certain businesses in certain
circumstances.  Those were merely pleasant side effects of a motive
that was, at bottom, neither technical nor mercantile, but moral.
Furthermore, the "free as in freedom" position forced a glaring
inconsistency on corporations who wanted to support particular free
programs in one aspect of their business, but continue marketing
proprietary software in others.</p><p>These dilemmas came to a community that was already poised for
an identity crisis.  The programmers who actually
<span class="emphasis"><em>write</em></span> free software have never been of one mind
about the overall goal, if any, of the free software movement.  Even
to say that opinions run from one extreme to the other would be
misleading, in that it would falsely imply a linear range where there
is instead a multidimensional scattering.  However, two broad
categories of belief can be distinguished, if we are willing to ignore
subtleties for the moment.  One group takes Stallman's view, that the
freedom to share and modify is the most important thing, and that
therefore if you stop talking about freedom, you've left out the core
issue.  Others feel that the software itself is the most important
argument in its favor, and are uncomfortable with proclaiming
proprietary software inherently bad.  Some, but not all, free
software programmers believe that the author (or employer, in the case
of paid work)
<span class="emphasis"><em>should</em></span> have the right to control the terms of
distribution, and that no moral judgement need be attached to the
choice of particular terms.</p><p>For a long time, these differences did not need to be carefully
examined or articulated, but free software's burgeoning success in the
business world made the issue unavoidable.  In 1998, the term
<em class="firstterm">open source</em> was created as an alternative
to "free", by a coalition of programmers who eventually became The
Open Source Initiative (OSI).<sup>[<a name="idp5047232" href="#ftn.idp5047232" class="footnote">9</a>]</sup>  The OSI felt
not only that "free software" was potentially confusing, but that the
word "free" was just one symptom of a general problem: that the
movement needed a marketing program to pitch it to the corporate
world, and that talk of morals and the social benefits of sharing
would never fly in corporate boardrooms.  In their own words:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Open Source Initiative is a marketing
      program for free software. It's a pitch for "free software" on
      solid pragmatic grounds rather than ideological

      attitude and symbolism have. ...</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The case that needs to be made to most techies
      isn't about the concept of open source, but the name. Why not
      call it, as we traditionally have, free software?</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>One direct reason is that the term "free
      software" is easily misunderstood in ways that lead to
      conflict. ...</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>But the real reason for the re-labeling is a
      marketing one. We're trying to pitch our concept to the

      software" has been misunderstood by business persons, who
      mistake the desire to share with anti-commercialism, or worse,

text.  It refers to "our convictions", but smartly avoids spelling out
exactly what those convictions are.  For some, it might be the
conviction that code developed according to an open process will be
better code; for others, it might be the conviction that all
information should be shared.  There's the use of the word "theft" to
refer (presumably) to illegal copying&#8212;a usage that many object
to, on the grounds that it's not theft if the original possessor still
has the item afterwards.  There's the tantalizing hint that the free
software movement might be mistakenly accused of anti-commercialism,
but it leaves carefully unexamined the question of whether such an
accusation would have any basis in fact.</p><p>None of which is to say that the OSI's web site is inconsistent
or misleading.  It's not.  Rather, it is an example of exactly what
the OSI claims had been missing from the free software movement: good
marketing, where "good" means "viable in the business world."  The
Open Source Initiative gave a lot of people exactly what they had been
looking for&#8212;a vocabulary for talking about free software as a
development methodology and business strategy, instead of as a moral
crusade.</p></div><p>The appearance of the Open Source Initiative changed the
landscape of free software.  It formalized a dichotomy that had long
been unnamed, and in doing so forced the movement to acknowledge that
it had internal politics as well as external.  The effect today is
that both sides have had to find common ground, since most projects
include programmers from both camps, as well as participants who don't
fit any clear category.  This doesn't mean people never talk about
moral motivations&#8212;lapses in the traditional "hacker ethic" are
sometimes called out, for example.  But it is rare for a free software
/ open source developer to openly question the basic motivations of
others in a project.  The contribution trumps the contributor.  If
someone writes good code, you don't ask them whether they do it for
moral reasons, or because their employer paid them to, or because
they're building up their resumé, or whatever.  You evaluate
the contribution on technical grounds, and respond on technical
grounds.  Even explicitly political organizations like the Debian
project, whose goal is to offer a 100% free (that is, "free as in
freedom") computing environment, are fairly relaxed about integrating
with non-free code and cooperating with programmers who don't share
exactly the same goals.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Situation Today"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="today"></a>The Situation Today</h2></div></div></div><p>When running a free software project, you won't need to talk
about such weighty philosophical matters on a daily basis.
Programmers will not insist that everyone else in the project agree
with their views on all things (those who do insist on this quickly
find themselves unable to work in any project).  But you do need to be
aware that the question of "free" versus "open source" exists, partly
to avoid saying things that might be inimical to some of the
participants, and partly because understanding developers' motivations
is the best way&#8212;in some sense, the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
way&#8212;to manage a project.</p><p>Free software is a culture by choice.  To operate successfully
in it, you have to understand why people choose to be in it in the
first place.  Coercive techniques don't work.  If people are unhappy in
one project, they will just wander off to another one.  Free software
is remarkable even among volunteer communities for its lightness of
investment.  Most of the people involved have never actually met the
other participants face-to-face, and simply donate bits of time
whenever they feel like it.  The normal conduits by which humans bond
with each other and form lasting groups are narrowed down to a tiny
channel: the written word, carried over electronic wires.  Because of
this, it can take a long time for a cohesive and dedicated group to
form.  Conversely, it's quite easy for a project to lose a potential
volunteer in the first five minutes of acquaintanceship.  If a project
doesn't make a good first impression, newcomers rarely give it a
second chance.</p><p>The transience, or rather the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span>
transience, of relationships is perhaps the single most daunting task
facing a new project.  What will persuade all these people to stick
together long enough to produce something useful?  The answer to that
question is complex enough to occupy the rest of this book, but if it
had to be expressed in one sentence, it would be this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>People should feel that their connection to a
      project, and influence over it, is directly proportional to
      their contributions.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>No class of developers, or potential developers, should ever
feel discounted or discriminated against for non-technical reasons.
Clearly, projects with corporate sponsorship and/or salaried
developers need to be especially careful in this regard, as <a class="xref" href="#money" title="Rozdzia&#322; 5. Money">Rozdzia&#322; 5, <i>Money</i></a> discusses in detail.  Of course, this doesn't
mean that if there's no corporate sponsorship then you have nothing to
worry about.  Money is merely one of many factors that can affect the
success of a project.  There are also questions of what language to
choose, what license, what development process, precisely what kind of
infrastructure to set up, how to publicize the project's inception
effectively, and much more.  Starting a project out on the right foot
is the topic of <a class="link" href="#getting-started" title="Rozdzia&#322; 2. Zaczynamy">the next

      a developer's personal itch.</em></span></p><p>(z <span class="bold"><strong><a class="ulink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/" target="_top">http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/</a>
      </strong></span>)</p></blockquote></div><p>Note that Raymond wasn't saying that open source projects happen
only when some individual gets an itch.  Rather, he was saying that
<span class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span> software results when the programmer has a
personal interest in seeing the problem solved; the relevance of this
to free software was that a personal itch happened to be the most
frequent motivation for starting a free software project.</p><p>This is still how most free projects are started, but less so
now than in 1997, when Raymond wrote those words.  Today, we have the
phenomenon of organizations&#8212;including for-profit
corporations&#8212;starting large, centrally-managed open source
projects from scratch.  The lone programmer, banging out some code to
solve a local problem and then realizing the result has wider
applicability, is still the source of much new free software, but is
not the only story.</p><p>Raymond's point is still insightful, however.  The essential
condition is that the producers of the software have a direct interest
in its success, because they use it themselves.  If the software
doesn't do what it's supposed to do, the person or organization
producing it will feel the dissatisfaction in their daily work.  For
example, the OpenAdapter project (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.openadapter.org/" target="_top">http://www.openadapter.org/</a>), which was started by investment
bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein as an open source framework for
integrating disparate financial information systems, can hardly be
said to scratch any individual programmer's personal itch.  It
scratches an institutional itch.  But that itch arises directly from
the experiences of the institution and its partners, and therefore if
the project fails to relieve them, they will know.  This arrangement
produces good software because the feedback loop flows in the right
direction.  The program isn't being written to be sold to someone else
so they can solve <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> problem.  It's being
written to solve one's <span class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> problem, and then
shared with everyone, much as though the problem were a disease and
the software were medicine whose distribution is meant to completely
eradicate the epidemic.</p><p>This chapter is about how to introduce a new free software
project to the world, but many of its recommendations would sound
familiar to a health organization distributing medicine.  The goals
are very similar: you want to make it clear what the medicine does,
get it into the hands of the right people, and make sure that those
who receive it know how to use it.  But with software, you also want
to entice some of the recipients into joining the ongoing research
effort to improve the medicine.</p><p>Free software distribution is a twofold task.  The software
needs to acquire users, and to acquire developers.  These two needs
are not necessarily in conflict, but they do add some complexity to a
project's initial presentation.  Some information is useful for both
audiences, some is useful only for one or the other.  Both kinds of
information should subscribe to the principle of scaled presentation;
that is, the degree of detail presented at each stage should
correspond directly to the amount of time and effort put in by the
reader.  More effort should always equal more reward.  When the two do
not correlate tightly, people may quickly lose faith and stop
investing effort.</p><p>The corollary to this is that <span class="emphasis"><em>appearances
matter</em></span>.  Programmers, in particular, often don't like to
believe this.  Their love of substance over form is almost a point of
professional pride.  It's no accident that so many programmers exhibit
an antipathy for marketing and public relations work, nor that
professional graphic designers are often horrified at what programmers
come up with on their own.</p><p>This is a pity, because there are situations where form
<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> substance, and project presentation is one of
them.  For example, the very first thing a visitor learns about a
project is what its web site looks like.  This information is absorbed
before any of the actual content on the site is
comprehended&#8212;before any of the text has been read or links
clicked on.  However unjust it may be, people cannot stop themselves
from forming an immediate first impression.  The site's appearance
signals whether care was taken in organizing the project's
presentation.  Humans have extremely sensitive antennae for detecting
the investment of care.  Most of us can tell in one glance whether a
web site was thrown together quickly or was given serious thought.
This is the first piece of information your project puts out, and the
impression it creates will carry over to the rest of the project by
association.</p><p>Thus, while much of this chapter talks about the content your
project should start out with, remember that its look and feel matter
too.  Because the project web site has to work for two different types
of visitors&#8212;users and developers&#8212;special attention
must be paid to clarity and directedness.  Although this is not the
place for a general treatise on web design, one principle is important
enough to deserve mention, particularly when the site serves multiple
(if overlapping) audiences: people should have a rough idea where a
link goes before clicking on it.  For example, it should be obvious
<span class="emphasis"><em>from looking at the links</em></span> to user documentation
that they lead to user documentation, and not to, say, developer
documentation.  Running a project is partly about supplying
information, but it's also about supplying comfort.  The mere presence
of certain standard offerings, in expected places, reassures users and
developers who are deciding whether they want to get involved.  It
says that this project has its act together, has anticipated the
questions people will ask, and has made an effort to answer them in a
way that requires minimal exertion on the part of the asker.  By
giving off this aura of preparedness, the project sends out a message:
"Your time will not be wasted if you get involved," which is exactly
what people need to hear.</p><div class="sect2" title="Zanim zaczniesz, rozejrzyj si&#281;"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="look-around"></a>Zanim zaczniesz, rozejrzyj si&#281;</h3></div></div></div><p>Jedno ostrze&#380;enie zanim rozpoczniesz nowy, otwarty projekt:</p><p>Zawsze rozejrzyj si&#281; za projektem, który robi to czego by&#347; chcia&#322;.

your needs, and decided to start a new project.</p><p>What now?</p><p>The hardest part about launching a free software project is
transforming a private vision into a public one.  You or your
organization may know perfectly well what you want, but expressing
that goal comprehensibly to the world is a fair amount of work.  It is
essential, however, that you take the time to do it.  You and the
other founders must decide what the project is really about&#8212;that
is, decide its limitations, what it <span class="emphasis"><em>won't</em></span> do as
well as what it will&#8212;and write up a mission statement.  This
part is usually not too hard, though it can sometimes reveal unspoken
assumptions and even disagreements about the nature of the project,
which is fine: better to resolve those now than later.  The next step
is to package up the project for public consumption, and this is,
basically, pure drudgery.</p><p>What makes it so laborious is that it consists mainly of
organizing and documenting things everyone already
knows&#8212;"everyone", that is, who's been involved in the project so
far.  Thus, for the people doing the work, there is no immediate
benefit.  They do not need a <code class="filename">README</code> file giving
an overview of the project, nor a design document or user manual.
They do not need a carefully arranged code tree conforming to the
informal but widespread standards of software source distributions.
Whatever way the source code is arranged is fine for them, because
they're already accustomed to it anyway, and if the code runs at all,
they know how to use it.  It doesn't even matter, for them, if the
fundamental architectural assumptions of the project remain
undocumented; they're already familiar with that too.</p><p>Newcomers, on the other hand, need these things.  Fortunately,
they don't need them all at once.  It's not necessary for you to
provide every possible resource before taking a project public.  In a
perfect world, perhaps, every new open source project would start out
life with a thorough design document, a complete user manual (with
special markings for features planned but not yet implemented),
beautifully and portably packaged code, capable of running on any
computing platform, and so on.  In reality, taking care of all these
loose ends would be prohibitively time-consuming, and anyway, it's
work that one can reasonably hope volunteers will help with once the
project is under way.</p><p>What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> necessary, however, is that enough
investment be put into presentation that newcomers can get past the
initial obstacle of unfamiliarity.  Think of it as the first step in a
bootstrapping process, to bring the project to a kind of minimum
activation energy.  I've heard this threshold called the
<em class="firstterm">hacktivation energy</em>: the amount of energy a
newcomer must put in before she starts getting something back.  The
lower a project's hacktivation energy, the better.  Your first task is
bring the hacktivation energy down to a level that encourages people
to get involved.</p><p>Each of the following subsections describes one important aspect
of starting a new project.  They are presented roughly in the order
that a new visitor would encounter them, though of course the order in
which you actually implement them might be different.  You can treat
them as a checklist.  When starting a project, just go down the list
and make sure you've got each item covered, or at least that you're
comfortable with the potential consequences if you've left one
out.</p><div class="sect2" title="Wybierz dobr&#261; nazw&#281;"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="choosing-a-name"></a>Wybierz dobr&#261; nazw&#281;</h3></div></div></div><p>Postaw si&#281; w sytuacji kogo&#347;, kto w&#322;a&#347;nie dowiedzia&#322; si&#281; o istnieniu

</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Have a Clear Mission Statement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mission-statement"></a>Have a Clear Mission Statement</h3></div></div></div><p>Once they've found the project's web site, the next thing people
will look for is a quick description, a mission statement, so they can
decide (within 30 seconds) whether or not they're interested in
learning more.  This should be prominently placed on the front page,
preferably right under the project's name.</p><p>The mission statement should be concrete, limiting, and above
all, short.  Here's an example of a good one, from <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_top">http://www.openoffice.org/</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>To create, as a community, the leading international
  office suite that will run on all major platforms and provide access
  to all functionality and data through open-component based APIs and
  an XML-based file format.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>In just a few words, they've hit all the high points, largely by
drawing on the reader's prior knowledge.  By saying "<span class="emphasis"><em>as a
community</em></span>", they signal that no one corporation will
dominate development; "<span class="emphasis"><em>international</em></span>" means that
the software will allow people to work in multiple languages and
locales; "<span class="emphasis"><em>all major platforms</em></span>" means it will be
portable to Unix, Macintosh, and Windows.  The rest signals that open
interfaces and easily understandable file formats are an important
part of the goal.  They don't come right out and say that they're
trying to be a free alternative to Microsoft Office, but most people
can probably read between the lines.  Although this mission statement
looks broad at first glance, in fact it is quite circumscribed: the
words "<span class="emphasis"><em>office suite</em></span>" mean something very concrete
to those familiar with such software.  Again, the reader's presumed
prior knowledge (in this case probably from MS Office) is used to keep
the mission statement concise.</p><p>The nature of a mission statement depends partly on who is
writing it, not just on the software it describes.  For example, it
makes sense for OpenOffice.org to use the words "<span class="emphasis"><em>as a
community</em></span>", because the project was started, and is still
largely sponsored, by Sun Microsystems.  By including those words, Sun
indicates its sensitivity to worries that it might try to dominate the
development process.  With this sort of thing, merely demonstrating
awareness of the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span> for a problem goes a
long way toward avoiding the problem entirely.  On the other hand,
projects that aren't sponsored by a single corporation probably don't
need such language; after all, development by community is the norm,
so there would ordinarily be no reason to list it as part of the
mission.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="State That the Project is Free"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="state-freedom"></a>State That the Project is Free</h3></div></div></div><p>Those who remain interested after reading the mission statement
will next want to see more details, perhaps some user or developer
documentation, and eventually will want to download something.  But
before any of that, they'll need to be sure it's open source.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The front page must make it unambiguously clear that
the project is open source.</em></span> This may seem obvious, but you
would be surprised how many projects forget to do it.  I have seen
free software project web sites where the front page not only did not
say which particular free license the software was distributed under,
but did not even state outright that the software was free at all.
Sometimes the crucial bit of information was relegated to the
Downloads page, or the Developers page, or some other place that
required one more mouse click to get to.  In extreme cases, the
license was not given anywhere on the web site at all&#8212;the only
way to find it was to download the software and look inside.</p><p>Don't make this mistake.  Such an omission can lose many
potential developers and users.  State up front, right below the
mission statement, that the project is "free software" or "open source
software", and give the exact license.  A quick guide to choosing a
license is given in
<a class="xref" href="#license-quickstart" title="Choosing a License and Applying It">&#8222;Choosing a License and Applying It&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>, and
licensing issues are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="#legal" title="Rozdzia&#322; 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Rozdzia&#322; 9, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a>.</p><p>At this point, our hypothetical visitor has
determined&#8212;probably in a minute or less&#8212;that she's
interested in spending, say, at least five more minutes investigating
this project.  The next sections describe what she should encounter in
that five minutes.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Features and Requirements List"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="features-and-requirements"></a>Features and Requirements List</h3></div></div></div><p>There should be a brief list of the features the software
supports (if something isn't completed yet, you can still list it, but
put "<span class="emphasis"><em>planned</em></span>" or
"<span class="emphasis"><em>in progress</em></span>" next to it), and the kind of
computing environment required to run the software.  Think of the
features/requirements list as what you would give to someone asking
for a quick summary of the software.  It is often just a logical
expansion of the mission statement.  For example, the mission
statement might say:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>To create a full-text indexer and search engine
  with a rich API, for use by programmers in providing search
  services for large collections of text files.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The features and requirements list would give the details,
clarifying the mission statement's scope:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Features:</em></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Searches plain text, HTML, and
                XML</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Word or phrase searching</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>(planned) Fuzzy matching</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>(planned) Incremental updating of
                indexes</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>(planned) Indexing of remote web
                sites</em></span></p></li></ul></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Requirements:</em></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Python 2.2 or higher</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Enough disk space to hold the indexes
                (approximately 2x original data size)</em></span></p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>With this information, readers can quickly get a feel for
whether this software has any hope of working for them, and they can
consider getting involved as developers too.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Development Status"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="development-status"></a>Development Status</h3></div></div></div><p>People always want to know how a project is doing.  For new
projects, they want to know the gap between the project's promise and
current reality.  For mature projects, they want to know how actively
it is maintained, how often it puts out new releases, how responsive
it is likely to be to bug reports, etc.</p><p>To answer these questions, you should provide a development
status page, listing the project's near-term goals and needs (for
example, it might be looking for developers with a particular kind of
expertise).  The page can also give a history of past releases, with
feature lists, so visitors can get an idea of how the project defines
"progress" and how quickly it makes progress according to that
definition.</p><p>Don't be afraid of looking unready, and don't give in to the
temptation to hype the development status.  Everyone knows that
software evolves by stages; there's no shame in saying "This is alpha
software with known bugs.  It runs, and works at least some of the
time, but use at your own risk."  Such language won't scare away the
kinds of developers you need at that stage.  As for users, one of the
worst things a project can do is attract users before the software is
ready for them.  A reputation for instability or bugginess is very
hard to shake, once acquired.  Conservativism pays off in the long
run; it's always better for the software to be
<span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> stable than the user expected than less, and
pleasant surprises produce the best kind of word-of-mouth.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Alpha and Beta"><a name="alpha-and-beta"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Alpha and Beta</b></p></div></div></div><p>The term <em class="firstterm">alpha</em> usually means a first
  release, with which users can get real work done and which has all
  the intended functionality, but which also has known bugs.  The main
  purpose of alpha software is to generate feedback, so the developers
  know what to work on.  The next stage, <em class="firstterm">beta</em>,
  means the software has had all the serious bugs fixed, but has not
  yet been tested enough to certify for release.  The purpose of beta
  software is to either become the official release, assuming no bugs
  are found, or provide detailed feedback to the developers so they
  can reach the official release quickly.  The difference between
  alpha and beta is very much a matter of judgement.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Downloads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="downloads"></a>Downloads</h3></div></div></div><p>The software should be downloadable as source code in standard
formats.  When a project is first getting started, binary (executable)
packages are not necessary, unless the software has such complicated
build requirements or dependencies that merely getting it to run would
be a lot of work for most people.  (But if this is the case, the
project is going to have a hard time attracting developers
anyway!)</p><p>The distribution mechanism should be as convenient, standard,
and low-overhead as possible.  If you were trying to eradicate a
disease, you wouldn't distribute the medicine in such a way that it
requires a non-standard syringe size to administer.  Likewise,
software should conform to standard build and installation methods;
the more it deviates from the standards, the more potential users and
developers will give up and go away confused.</p><p>That sounds obvious, but many projects don't bother to
standardize their installation procedures until very late in the game,
telling themselves they can do it any time: <span class="emphasis"><em>"We'll sort all
that stuff out when the code is closer to being ready."</em></span>
What they don't realize is that by putting off the boring work of
finishing the build and installation procedures, they are actually
making the code take longer to get ready&#8212;because they
discourage developers who might otherwise have contributed to the
code.  Most insidiously, they don't <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> they're
losing all those developers, because the process is an accumulation of
non-events: someone visits a web site, downloads the software, tries
to build it, fails, gives up and goes away.  Who will ever know it
happened, except the person themselves?  No one working on the project
will realize that someone's interest and good will have been silently
squandered.</p><p>Boring work with a high payoff should always be done early, and
significantly lowering the project's barrier to entry through good
packaging brings a very high payoff.</p><p>When you release a downloadable package, it is vital that you
give a unique version number to the release, so that people can
compare any two releases and know which supersedes the other.  A
detailed discussion of version numbering can be found in <a class="xref" href="#release-numbering" title="Release Numbering">&#8222;Release Numbering&#8221;</a>, and the details of standardizing
build and installation procedures are covered in
<a class="xref" href="#packaging" title="Packaging">&#8222;Packaging&#8221;</a><span>, both
in <a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Rozdzia&#322; 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Rozdzia&#322; 7, <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Version Control and Bug Tracker Access"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="vc-and-bug-tracker-access"></a>Version Control and Bug Tracker Access</h3></div></div></div><p>Downloading source packages is fine for those who just want to
install and use the software, but it's not enough for those who want
to debug or add new features.  Nightly source snapshots can help, but
they're still not fine-grained enough for a thriving development
community.  People need real-time access to the latest sources, and
the way to give them that is to use a version control system.  The
presence of anonymously accessible version controlled sources is a
sign&#8212;to both users and developers&#8212;that this project is
making an effort to give people what they need to participate.  If you
can't offer version control right away, then put up a sign saying you
intend to set it up soon.  Version control infrastructure is discussed
in detail in <a class="xref" href="#vc" title="Kontrola wersji">&#8222;Kontrola wersji&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>.</p><p>The same goes for the project's bug tracker.  The importance of
a bug tracking system lies not only in its usefulness to developers,
but in what it signifies for project observers.  For many people, an
accessible bug database is one of the strongest signs that a project
should be taken seriously.  Furthermore, the higher the number of bugs
in the database, the better the project looks.  This might seem
counterintuitive, but remember that the number of bugs recorded really
depends on three things: the absolute number of bugs present in the
software, the number of users using the software, and the convenience
with which those users can register new bugs.  Of these three factors,
the latter two are more significant than the first.  Any software of
sufficient size and complexity has an essentially arbitrary number of
bugs waiting to be discovered.  The real question is, how well will
the project do at recording and prioritizing those bugs?  A project
with a large and well-maintained bug database (meaning bugs are
responded to promptly, duplicate bugs are unified, etc.) therefore
makes a better impression than a project with no bug database, or a
nearly empty database.</p><p>Of course, if your project is just getting started, then the bug
database will contain very few bugs, and there's not much you can do
about that.  But if the status page emphasizes the project's youth,
and if people looking at the bug database can see that most filings have
taken place recently, they can extrapolate from that that the project
still has a healthy <span class="emphasis"><em>rate</em></span> of filings, and they
will not be unduly alarmed by the low absolute number of bugs
recorded.</p><p>Note that bug trackers are often used to track not only software
bugs, but enhancement requests, documentation changes, pending tasks,
and more.  The details of running a bug tracker are covered in
<a class="xref" href="#bug-tracker" title="Bug Tracker">&#8222;Bug Tracker&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>, so I won't
go into them here.  The important thing from a presentation point of
view is just to <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> a bug tracker, and to make
sure that fact is visible from the front page of the project.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Communications Channels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="communications-channels"></a>Communications Channels</h3></div></div></div><p>Visitors usually want to know how to reach the human beings
involved with the project.  Provide the addresses of mailing lists,
chat rooms, and IRC channels, and any other forums where others
involved with the software can be reached.  Make it clear that you and
the other authors of the project are subscribed to these mailing
lists, so people see there's a way to give feedback that will reach
the developers.  Your presence on the lists does not imply a
committment to answer all questions or implement all feature requests.
In the long run, most users will probably never join the forums
anyway, but they will be comforted to know that they
<span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> if they ever needed to.</p><p>In the early stages of a project, there's no need to have
separate user and developer forums.  It's much better to have everyone
involved with the software talking together, in one "room."  Among
early adopters, the distinction between developer and user is often
fuzzy; to the extent that the distinction can be made, the ratio of
developers to users is usually much higher in the early days of the
project than later on.  While you can't assume that every early
adopter is a programmer who wants to hack on the software, you can
assume that they are at least interested in following development
discussions and in getting a sense of the project's direction.</p><p>As this chapter is only about getting a project started, it's
enough merely to say that these communications forums need to exist.
Later, in <a class="xref" href="#growth" title="Handling Growth">&#8222;Handling Growth&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>, we'll examine where
and how to set up such forums, the ways in which they might need
moderation or other management, and how to separate user forums from
developer forums, when the time comes, without creating an
unbridgeable gulf.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Developer Guidelines"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="developer-guidelines"></a>Developer Guidelines</h3></div></div></div><p>If someone is considering contributing to the project, she'll
look for developer guidelines.  Developer guidelines are not so much
technical as social: they explain how the developers interact with
each other and with the users, and ultimately how things get
done.</p><p>This topic is covered in detail in
<a class="xref" href="#written-rules" title="Writing It All Down">&#8222;Writing It All Down&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Rozdzia&#322; 4, <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>, but the basic
elements of developer guidelines are:

            benevolent dictatorship, a democracy, or something
            else</p></li></ul></div><p>

No pejorative sense is intended by "dictatorship", by the way.  It's
perfectly okay to run a tyranny where one particular developer has
veto power over all changes.  Many successful projects work this way.
The important thing is that the project come right out and say so.  A
tyranny pretending to be a democracy will turn people off; a tyranny
that says it's a tyranny will do fine as long as the tyrant is
competent and trusted.</p><p>See <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</a>

the software is discussed in <a class="xref" href="#developer-documentation" title="Developer documentation">&#8222;Developer documentation&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="documentation"></a>Documentation</h3></div></div></div><p>Documentation is essential.  There needs to be
<span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> for people to read, even if it's
rudimentary and incomplete.  This falls squarely into the "drudgery"
category referred to earlier, and is often the first area where a new
open source projects falls down.  Coming up with a mission statement
and feature list, choosing a license, summarizing development
status&#8212;these are all relatively small tasks, which can be
definitively completed and usually need not be returned to once done.
Documentation, on the other hand, is never really finished, which may
be one reason people sometimes delay starting it at all.</p><p>The most insidious thing is that documentation's utility to
those writing it is the reverse of its utility to those who will read
it.  The most important documentation for initial users is the basics:
how to quickly set up the software, an overview of how it works,
perhaps some guides to doing common tasks.  Yet these are exactly the
things the <span class="emphasis"><em>writers</em></span> of the documentation know all
too well&#8212;so well that it can be difficult for them to see
things from the reader's point of view, and to laboriously spell out
the steps that (to the writers) seem so obvious as to be unworthy of
mention.</p><p>There's no magic solution to this problem.  Someone just needs
to sit down and write the stuff, and then run it by typical new users
to test its quality.  Use a simple, easy-to-edit format such as HTML,
plain text, Texinfo, or some variant of XML&#8212;something that's
convenient for lightweight, quick improvements on the spur of the
moment.  This is not only to remove any overhead that might impede the
original writers from making incremental improvements, but also for
those who join the project later and want to work on the
documentation.</p><p>One way to ensure basic initial documentation gets done is to
limit its scope in advance.  That way, writing it at least won't feel
like an open-ended task.  A good rule of thumb is that it should meet
the following minimal criteria:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Tell the reader clearly how much technical
            expertise they're expected to have.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe clearly and thoroughly how to set up
            the software, and somewhere near the beginning of the
            documentation, tell the user how to run some sort of
            diagnostic test or simple command to confirm that
            they've set things up correctly.  Startup
            documentation is in some ways more important than
            actual usage documentation.  The more effort someone has
            invested in installing and getting started with the
            software, the more persistent she'll be in figuring out
            advanced functionality that's not well-documented.
            When people abandon, they abandon early; therefore,
            it's the earliest stages, like installation, that need
            the most support.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Give one tutorial-style example of how to do a
            common task.  Obviously, many examples for many tasks
            would be even better, but if time is limited, pick one
            task and walk through it thoroughly.  Once someone
            sees that the software <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be
            used for one thing, they'll start to explore what else
            it can do on their own&#8212;and, if you're lucky,
            start filling in the documentation themselves.  Which
            brings us to the next point...</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Label the areas where the documentation is known
            to be incomplete.  By showing the readers that you are
            aware of its deficiencies, you align yourself with
            their point of view.  Your empathy reassures them that
            they don't face a struggle to convince the project of
            what's important.  These labels needn't represent
            promises to fill in the gaps by any particular date
           &#8212;it's equally legitimate to treat them as open
            requests for volunteer help.</p></li></ul></div><p>The last point is of wider importance, actually, and can be
applied to the entire project, not just the documentation.  An
accurate accounting of known deficiencies is the norm in the open
source world.  You don't have to exaggerate the project's
shortcomings, just identify them scrupulously and dispassionately when
the context calls for it (whether in the documentation, in the bug
tracking database, or on a mailing list discussion).  No one will
treat this as defeatism on the part of the project, nor as a
commitment to solve the problems by a certain date, unless the project
makes such a commitment explicitly.  Since anyone who uses the
software will discover the deficiencies for themselves, it's much
better for them to be psychologically prepared&#8212;then the
project will look like it has a solid knowledge of how it's
doing.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Maintaining a FAQ"><a name="starting-a-faq"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Maintaining a FAQ</b></p></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">FAQ</em> ("Frequently Asked Questions"
  document) can be one of the best investments a project makes in
  terms of educational payoff.  FAQs are highly tuned to the questions
  users and developers actually ask&#8212;as opposed to the questions
  you might have <span class="emphasis"><em>expected</em></span> them to ask&#8212;and
  therefore, a well-maintained FAQ tends to give those who consult it
  exactly what they're looking for.  The FAQ is often the first place
  users look when they encounter a problem, often even in preference
  to the official manual, and it's probably the document in your
  project most likely to be linked to from other sites.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot make the FAQ at the start of the
  project.  Good FAQs are not written, they are grown.  They are by
  definition reactive documents, evolving over time in response to
  people's day-to-day usage of the software.  Since it's impossible to
  correctly anticipate the questions people will ask, it is impossible
  to sit down and write a useful FAQ from scratch.</p><p>Therefore, don't waste your time trying to.  You may, however,
  find it useful to set up a mostly blank FAQ template, so there will
  be an obvious place for people to contribute questions and answers
  after the project is under way.  At this stage, the most important
  property is not completeness, but convenience: if the FAQ is easy to
  add to, people will add to it.  (Proper FAQ maintenance is a
  non-trivial and intriguing problem, and is discussed more in <a class="xref" href="#faq-manager" title="Mened&#380;er FAQ">&#8222;Mened&#380;er FAQ&#8221;</a><span> in
  <a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span>.)</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Availability of documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="documentation-availability"></a>Availability of documentation</h4></div></div></div><p>Documentation should be available from two places: online
(directly from the web site), <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> in the
downloadable distribution of the software (see
<a class="xref" href="#packaging" title="Packaging">&#8222;Packaging&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Rozdzia&#322; 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Rozdzia&#322; 7, <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>).  It needs to be
online, in browsable form, because people often read documentation
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> downloading software for the first time,
as a way of helping them decide whether to download at all.  But it
should also accompany the software, on the principle that downloading
should supply (i.e., make locally accessible) everything one needs to
use the package.</p><p>For online documentation, make sure that there is a link that
brings up the <span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> documentation in one HTML
page (put a note like "monolithic" or "all-in-one" or "single large
page" next to the link, so people know that it might take a while to
load).  This is useful because people often want to search for a
specific word or phrase across the entire documentation.  Generally,
they already know what they're looking for; they just can't remember
what section it's in.  For such people, nothing is more frustrating
than encountering one HTML page for the table of contents, then a
different page for the introduction, then a different page for
installation instructions, etc.  When the pages are broken up like
that, their browser's search function is useless.  The separate-page
style is useful for those who already know what section they need, or
who want to read the entire documentation from front to back in
sequence.  But this is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the most common way
documentation is accessed.  Far more often, someone who is basically
familiar with the software is coming back to search for a specific
word or phrase.  To fail to provide them with a single, searchable
document would only make their lives harder.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Developer documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="developer-documentation"></a>Developer documentation</h4></div></div></div><p>Developer documentation is written to help programmers
understand the code, so they can repair and extend it.  This is
somewhat different from the <span class="emphasis"><em>developer guidelines</em></span>
discussed earlier, which are more social than technical.  Developer
guidelines tell programmers how to get along with each other;
developer documentation tells them how to get along with the code
itself.  The two are often packaged together in one document for
convenience (as with the <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</a> example given
earlier), but they don't have to be.</p><p>Although developer documentation can be very helpful, there's no
reason to delay a release to do it.  As long as the original authors
are available (and willing) to answer questions about the code, that's
enough to start with.  In fact, having to answer the same questions
over and over is a common motivation for writing documentation.  But
even before it's written, determined contributors will still manage to
find their way around the code.  The force that drives people to spend
time learning a code base is that the code does something useful for
them.  If people have faith in that, they will take the time to figure
things out; if they don't have that faith, no amount of developer
documentation will get or keep them.</p><p>So if you have time to write documentation for only one
audience, write it for users.  All user documentation is, in effect,
developer documentation as well; any programmer who's going to work on
a piece of software will need to be familiar with how to use it.
Later, when you see programmers asking the same questions over and
over, take the time to write up some separate documents just for
them.</p><p>Some projects use wikis for their initial documentation, or even
as their primary documentation.  In my experience, this really only
works if the wiki is actively edited by a few people who agree on how
the documentation is to be organized and what sort of "voice" it
should have.  See

produces graphical or otherwise distinctive output, put some samples
up on the project web site.  In the case of interface, this means
screenshots; for output, it might be screenshots or just files.  Both
cater to people's need for instant gratification: a single screenshot
can be more convincing than paragraphs of descriptive text and mailing
list chatter, because a screenshot is inarguable proof that the
software <span class="emphasis"><em>works</em></span>.  It may be buggy, it may be hard
to install, it may be incompletely documented, but that screenshot is
still proof that if one puts in enough effort, one can get it to
run.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Screenshots"><a name="screenshots"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Screenshots</b></p></div></div></div><p>Since screenshots can be daunting until you've actually made a
  few, here are basic instructions for making them.  Using the Gimp

site, if you have the time, or if for one reason or another they are
especially appropriate: a news page, a project history page, a related
links page, a site-search feature, a donations link, etc.  None of
these are necessities at startup time, but keep them in mind for the
future.</p><div class="sect2" title="Canned Hosting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="starting-with-canned-hosting"></a>Canned Hosting</h3></div></div></div><p>There are a few sites that provide free hosting and
infrastructure for open source projects: a web area, version control,
a bug tracker, a download area, chat forums, regular backups, etc.
The details vary from site to site, but the same basic services are
offered at all of them.  By using one of these sites, you get a lot
for free; what you give up, obviously, is fine-grained control over
the user experience.  The hosting service decides what software the
site runs, and may control or at least influence the look and feel of
the project's web pages.</p><p>See

Most of them we needn't consider here, as they were written to satisfy
the particular legal needs of some corporation or person, and wouldn't

an <em class="firstterm">MIT/X-style</em> license.  It is the simplest of
several minimal licenses that do little more than assert nominal
copyright (without actually restricting copying) and specify that the
code comes with no warranty.  See

use the GNU General Public License
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>).  The GPL is
probably the most widely recognized free software license in the world
today.  This is in itself a big advantage, since many potential users
and contributors will already be familiar with it, and therefore won't
have to spend extra time to read and understand your license.  See

project's front page.  You don't need to include the actual text of
the license there; just give the name of the license, and make it link
to the full license text on another page.</p><p>This tells the public what license you
<span class="emphasis"><em>intend</em></span> the software to be released under, but
it's not sufficient for legal purposes.  For that, the software itself
must contain the license.  The standard way to do this is to put the
full license text in a file called <code class="filename">COPYING</code> (or
<code class="filename">LICENSE</code>), and then put a short notice at the top
of each source file, naming the copyright date, holder, and license,
and saying where to find the full text of the license.</p><p>There are many variations on this pattern, so we'll look at just
one example here.  The GNU GPL says to put a notice like this at the
top of each source file:</p><pre class="screen">

received along with the program is in the file
<code class="filename">COPYING</code>, but that's where it's usually put.  (You
could change the above notice to state that directly.)  This template
also gives a geographical address from which to request a copy of the
license.  Another common method is to give a link to a web page
containing the license.  Just use your judgement and point to wherever
you feel the most permanent copy of the license is maintained, which
might simply be somewhere on your project's web site.  In general, the
notice you put in each source file does not have to look exactly like
the one above, as long as it starts with the same notice of copyright
holder and date, states the name of the license, and makes it clear
where to view the full license.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Setting the Tone"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="setting-tone"></a>Setting the Tone</h2></div></div></div><p>So far we've covered one-time tasks you do during project setup:
picking a license, arranging the initial web site, etc.  But the most
important aspects of starting a new project are dynamic.  Choosing a
mailing list address is easy; ensuring that the list's conversations
remain on-topic and productive is another matter entirely.  If the
project is being opened up after years of closed, in-house
development, its development processes will change, and you will have
to prepare the existing developers for that change.</p><p>The first steps are the hardest, because precedents and
expectations for future conduct have not yet been set.  Stability in a
project does not come from formal policies, but from a shared,
hard-to-pin-down collective wisdom that develops over time.  There are
often written rules as well, but they tend to be essentially a
distillation of the intangible, ever-evolving agreements that really
guide the project.  The written policies do not define the project's
culture so much as describe it, and even then only
approximately.</p><p>There are a few reasons why things work out this way.  Growth
and high turnover are not as damaging to the accumulation of social
norms as one might think.  As long as change does not happen
<span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> quickly, there is time for new arrivals to
learn how things are done, and after they learn, they will help
reinforce those ways themselves.  Consider how children's songs
survive the centuries.  There are children today singing roughly the
same rhymes as children did hundreds of years ago, even though there
are no children alive now who were alive then.  Younger children hear
the songs sung by older ones, and when they are older, they in turn
will sing them in front of other younger ones.  The children are not
engaging in a conscious program of transmission, of course, but the
reason the songs survive is nonetheless that they are transmitted
regularly and repeatedly.  The time scale of free software projects
may not be measured in centuries (we don't know yet), but the dynamics
of transmission are much the same.  The turnover rate is faster,
however, and must be compensated for by a more active and deliberate
transmission effort.</p><p>This effort is aided by the fact that people generally show up
expecting and looking for social norms.  That's just how humans are
built.  In any group unified by a common endeavor, people who join
instinctively search for behaviors that will mark them as part of the
group.  The goal of setting precedents early is to make those
"in-group" behaviors be ones that are useful to the project; for once
established, they will be largely self-perpetuating.</p><p>Following are some examples of specific things you can do to set
good precedents.  They're not meant as an exhaustive list, just as
illustrations of the idea that setting a collaborative mood early
helps a project tremendously.  Physically, every developer may be
working alone in a room by themselves, but you can do a lot to make
them <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> like they're all working together in
the same room.  The more they feel this way, the more time they'll
want to spend on the project.  I chose these particular examples
because they came up in the Subversion project (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>),
which I participated in and observed from its very beginning.  But
they're not unique to Subversion; situations like these will come up
in most open source projects, and should be seen as opportunities to
start things off on the right foot.</p><div class="sect2" title="Avoid Private Discussions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="avoid-private-discussions"></a>Avoid Private Discussions</h3></div></div></div><p>Even after you've taken the project public, you and the other
founders will often find yourselves wanting to settle difficult
questions by private communications among an inner circle.  This is
especially true in the early days of the project, when there are so
many important decisions to make, and, usually, few volunteers
qualified to make them.  All the obvious disadvantages of public list
discussions will loom palpably in front of you: the delay inherent in
email conversations, the need to leave sufficient time for consensus
to form, the hassle of dealing with naive volunteers who think they
understand all the issues but actually don't (every project has these;
sometimes they're next year's star contributors, sometimes they stay
naive forever), the person who can't understand why you only want to
solve problem X when it's obviously a subset of larger problem Y, and
so on.  The temptation to make decisions behind closed doors and
present them as <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">faits accomplis</em></span>, or at
least as the firm recommendations of a united and influential voting
block, will be great indeed.</p><p>Don't do it.</p><p>As slow and cumbersome as public discussions can be, they're
almost always preferable in the long run.  Making important decisions
in private is like spraying contributor repellant on your project.  No
serious volunteer would stick around for long in an environment where
a secret council makes all the big decisions.  Furthermore, public
discussion has beneficial side effects that will last beyond whatever
ephemeral technical question was at issue:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion will help train and educate new developers.
        You never know how many eyes are watching the conversation;
        even if most people don't participate, many may be tracking
        silently, gleaning information about the software.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion will train <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> in the art
        of explaining technical issues to people who are not as
        familiar with the software as you are.  This is a skill that
        requires practice, and you can't get that practice by talking
        to people who already know what you know.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion and its conclusions will be available in public
        archives forever after, enabling future discussions to avoid
        retracing the same steps.  See
        <a class="xref" href="#using-archives" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">&#8222;Conspicuous Use of Archives&#8221;</a><span>

</p><p>Finally, there is the possibility that someone on the list may
make a real contribution to the conversation, by coming up with an
idea you never anticipated.  It's hard to say how likely this is; it
just depends on the complexity of the code and degree of
specialization required.  But if anecdotal evidence may be permitted,
I would hazard that this is more likely than one would intuitively
expect.  In the Subversion project, we (the founders) believed we
faced a deep and complex set of problems, which we had been thinking
about hard for several months, and we frankly doubted that anyone on
the newly created mailing list was likely to make a real contribution
to the discussion.  So we took the lazy route and started batting some
technical ideas back and forth in private emails, until an observer of
the project<sup>[<a name="idp6165072" href="#ftn.idp6165072" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup> caught wind of what
was happening and asked for the discussion to be moved to the public
list.  Rolling our eyes a bit, we did&#8212;and were stunned by the
number of insightful comments and suggestions that quickly resulted.
In many cases people offered ideas that had never even occurred to us.
It turned out there were some <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> smart people
on that list; they'd just been waiting for the right bait.  It's true
that the ensuing discussions took longer than they would have if we
had kept the conversation private, but they were so much more
productive that it was well worth the extra time.</p><p>Without descending into hand-waving generalizations like "the
group is always smarter than the individual" (we've all met enough
groups to know better), it must be acknowledged that there are certain
activities at which groups excel.  Massive peer review is one of them;
generating large numbers of ideas quickly is another.  The quality of
the ideas depends on the quality of the thinking that went into them,
of course, but you won't know what kinds of thinkers are out there
until you stimulate them with a challenging problem.</p><p>Naturally, there are some discussions that must be had
privately; throughout this book we'll see examples of those.  But the
guiding principle should always be: <span class="emphasis"><em>If there's no reason for
it to be private, it should be public.</em></span></p><p>Making this happen requires action.  It's not enough merely to
ensure that all your own posts go to the public list.  You also have
to nudge other people's unnecessarily private conversations to the
list too.  If someone tries to start a private discussion, and there's
no reason for it to be private, then it is incumbent on you to open
the appropriate meta-discussion immediately.  Don't even comment on
the original topic until you've either successfully steered the
conversation to a public place, or ascertained that privacy really was
needed.  If you do this consistently, people will catch on pretty
quickly and start to use the public forums by default.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Nip Rudeness in the Bud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="prevent-rudeness"></a>Nip Rudeness in the Bud</h3></div></div></div><p>From the very start of your project's public existence, you
should maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward rude or insulting
behavior in its forums.  Zero-tolerance does not mean technical
enforcement per se.  You don't have to remove people from the mailing
list when they flame another subscriber, or take away their commit
access because they made derogatory comments.  (In theory, you might
eventually have to resort to such actions, but only after all other
avenues have failed&#8212;which, by definition, isn't the case at the
start of the project.)  Zero-tolerance simply means never letting bad
behavior slide by unnoticed.  For example, when someone posts a
technical comment mixed together with an <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hominem</em></span> attack on some other developer in the project,
it is imperative that your response address the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hominem</em></span> attack <span class="emphasis"><em>first</em></span>, as a
separate issue unto itself, and only afterward move on to the
technical content.</p><p>It is unfortunately very easy, and all too typical, for
constructive discussions to lapse into destructive flame wars.
People will say things in email that they would never say
face-to-face.  The topics of discussion only amplify this effect: in
technical issues, people often feel there is a single right answer to
most questions, and that disagreement with that answer can only be
explained by ignorance or stupidity.  It's a short distance from
calling someone's technical proposal stupid to calling the person
themselves stupid.  In fact, it's often hard to tell where technical
debate leaves off and character attack begins, which is one reason why
drastic responses or punishments are not a good idea.  Instead, when
you think you see it happening, make a post that stresses the
importance of keeping the discussion friendly, without accusing anyone
of being deliberately poisonous.  Such "Nice Police" posts do have an
unfortunate tendency to sound like a kindergarten teacher lecturing a
class on good behavior:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>First, let's please cut down on the
      (potentially) ad hominem comments; for example, calling J's
      design for the security layer "naive and ignorant of the basic
      principles of computer security."  That may be true or it may
      not, but in either case it's no way to have the discussion.  J
      made his proposal in good faith.  If it has deficiencies, point
      them out, and we'll fix them or get a new design.  I'm sure M
      meant no personal insult to J, but the phrasing was unfortunate,
      and we try to keep things constructive around here.
      </em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Now, on to the proposal.  I think M was right
      in saying that...</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>As stilted as such responses sound, they have a noticeable
effect.  If you consistently call out bad behavior, but don't demand
an apology or acknowledgment from the offending party, then you leave
people free to cool down and show their better side by behaving more
decorously next time&#8212;and they will.  One of the secrets of
doing this successfully is to never make the meta-discussion the main
topic.  It should always be an aside, a brief preface to the main
portion of your response.  Point out in passing that "we don't do
things that way around here," but then move on to the real content, so
that you're giving people something on-topic to respond to.  If
someone protests that they didn't deserve your rebuke, simply refuse
to be drawn into an argument about it.  Either don't respond (if you
think they're just letting off steam and don't require a response), or
say you're sorry if you overreacted and that it's hard to detect
nuance in email, then get back to the main topic.  Never, ever insist
on an acknowledgment, whether public or private, from someone that
they behaved inappropriately.  If they choose of their own volition to
post an apology, that's great, but demanding that they do so will only
cause resentment.</p><p>The overall goal is to make good etiquette be seen as one of the
"in-group" behaviors.  This helps the project, because developers can
be driven away (even from projects they like and want to support) by
flame wars.  You may not even know that they were driven away; someone
might lurk on the mailing list, see that it takes a thick skin to
participate in the project, and decide against getting involved at
all.  Keeping forums friendly is a long-term survival strategy, and
it's easier to do when the project is still small.  Once it's part of
the culture, you won't have to be the only person promoting it.  It
will be maintained by everyone.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="code-review"></a>Practice Conspicuous Code Review</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the best ways to foster a productive development
community is to get people looking at each others' code.  Some
technical infrastructure is required to do this effectively&#8212;in
particular, commit emails must be turned on; see
<a class="xref" href="#commit-emails" title="Powiadomienia o commitach">&#8222;Powiadomienia o commitach&#8221;</a> for more details.  The effect of
commit emails is that every time someone commits a change to the
source code, an email goes out showing the log message and diffs for
the change (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-diff"><em class="firstterm">diff</em></a>, in
<a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary" title="S&#322;ownictwo kontroli wersji">&#8222;S&#322;ownictwo kontroli wersji&#8221;</a>).  <em class="firstterm">Code review</em>
is the practice of reviewing commit emails as they come in, looking
for bugs and possible improvements.<sup>[<a name="idp6185968" href="#ftn.idp6185968" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup></p><p>Code review serves several purposes simultaneously.  It's the
most obvious example of peer review in the open source world, and
directly helps to maintain software quality.  Every bug that ships in
a piece of software got there by being committed and not detected;
therefore, the more eyes watch commits, the fewer bugs will ship.  But
code review also serves an indirect purpose: it confirms to people
that what they do matters, because one obviously wouldn't take time to
review a commit unless one cared about its effect.  People do their
best work when they know that others will take the time to evaluate
it.</p><p>Reviews should be public.  Even on occasions when I have been
sitting in the same physical room with developers, and one of us has
made a commit, we take care not to do the review verbally in the room,
but to send it to the development mailing list instead.  Everyone
benefits from seeing the review happen.  People follow the commentary
and sometimes find flaws in it, and even when they don't, it still
reminds them that review is an expected, regular activity, like
washing the dishes or mowing the lawn.</p><p>In the Subversion project, we did not at first make a regular
practice of code review.  There was no guarantee that every commit
would be reviewed, though one might sometimes look over a change if
one was particularly interested in that area of the code.  Bugs
slipped in that really could and should have been caught.  A developer
named Greg Stein, who knew the value of code review from past work,
decided that he was going to set an example by reviewing every line of
<span class="emphasis"><em>every single commit</em></span> that went into the code
repository.  Each commit anyone made was soon followed by an email to
the developer's list from Greg, dissecting the commit, analyzing
possible problems, and occasionally praising a clever bit of code.  Right
away, he was catching bugs and non-optimal coding practices that would
otherwise have slipped by without ever being noticed.  Pointedly, he
never complained about being the only person reviewing every commit,
even though it took a fair amount of his time, but he did sing the
praises of code review whenever he had the chance.  Pretty soon, other
people, myself included, started reviewing commits regularly too.
What was our motivation?  It wasn't that Greg had consciously shamed
us into it.  But he had proven that reviewing code was a valuable way
to spend time, and that one could contribute as much to the project by
reviewing others' changes as by writing new code.  Once he
demonstrated that, it became expected behavior, to the point where any
commit that didn't get some reaction would cause the committer to
worry, and even ask on the list whether anyone had had a chance to
review it yet.  Later, Greg got a job that didn't leave him as much
time for Subversion, and had to stop doing regular reviews.  But by
then, the habit was so ingrained for the rest of us as to seem that it
had been going on since time immemorial.</p><p>Start doing reviews from very first commit.  The sorts of
problems that are easiest to catch by reviewing diffs are security
vulnerabilities, memory leaks, insufficient comments or API
documentation, off-by-one errors, caller/callee discipline mismatches,
and other problems that require a minimum of surrounding context to
spot.  However, even larger-scale issues such as failure to abstract
repeated patterns to a single location become spottable after one has
been doing reviews regularly, because the memory of past diffs informs
the review of present diffs.</p><p>Don't worry that you might not find anything to comment on, or
that you don't know enough about every area of the code.  There will
usually be something to say about almost every commit; even where you
don't find anything to question, you may find something to praise.
The important thing is to make it clear to every committer that what
they do is seen and understood.  Of course, code review does not
absolve programmers of the responsibility to review and test their
changes before committing; no one should depend on code review to
catch things he ought to have caught on his own.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="When Opening a Formerly Closed Project, be Sensitive to the Magnitude of the Change"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="opening-closed-projects"></a>When Opening a Formerly Closed Project, be Sensitive to the
Magnitude of the Change</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're opening up an existing project, one that already has
active developers accustomed to working in a closed-source
environment, make sure everyone understands that a big change is
coming&#8212;and make sure that you understand how it's going to
feel from their point of view.</p><p>Try to imagine how the situation looks to them: formerly, all
code and design decisions were made with a group of other programmers
who knew the software more or less equally well, who all received the
same pressures from the same management, and who all know each others'
strengths and weaknesses.  Now you're asking them to expose their code
to the scrutiny of random strangers, who will form judgements based
only on the code, with no awareness of what business pressures may
have forced certain decisions.  These strangers will ask lots of
questions, questions that jolt the existing developers into realizing
that the documentation they slaved so hard over is
<span class="emphasis"><em>still</em></span> inadequate (this is inevitable).  To top it
all off, the newcomers are unknown, faceless entities.  If one of your
developers already feels insecure about his skills, imagine how that
will be exacerbated when newcomers point out flaws in code he wrote,
and worse, do so in front of his colleagues.  Unless you have a team
of perfect coders, this is unavoidable&#8212;in fact, it will probably
happen to all of them at first.  This is not because they're bad
programmers; it's just that any program above a certain size has bugs,
and peer review will spot some of those bugs (see
<a class="xref" href="#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">&#8222;Practice Conspicuous Code Review&#8221;</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>).  At the same time, the newcomers
themselves won't be subject to much peer review at first, since they
can't contribute code until they're more familiar with the project.
To your developers, it may feel like all the criticism is incoming,
never outgoing.  Thus, there is the danger of a siege mentality taking
hold among the old hands.</p><p>The best way to prevent this is to warn everyone about what's
coming, explain it, tell them that the initial discomfort is perfectly
normal, and reassure them that it's going to get better.  Some of
these warnings should take place privately, before the project is
opened.  But you may also find it helpful to remind people on the
public lists that this is a new way of development for the project,
and that it will take some time to adjust.  The very best thing you
can do is lead by example.  If you don't see your developers answering
enough newbie questions, then just telling them to answer more isn't
going to help.  They may not have a good sense of what warrants a
response and what doesn't yet, or it could be that they don't have a
feel for how to prioritize coding work against the new burden of
external communications.  The way to get them to participate is to
participate yourself.  Be on the public mailing lists, and make sure
to answer some questions there.  When you don't have the
expertise to field a question, then visibly hand it off to a developer
who does&#8212;and watch to make sure he follows up with an answer,
or at least a response.  It will naturally be tempting for the
longtime developers to lapse into private discussions, since that's
what they're used to.  Make sure you're subscribed to the internal
mailing lists on which this might happen, so you can ask that such
discussions be moved to the public lists right away.</p><p>There are other, longer-term concerns with opening up formerly

in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span> for advice on announcing
further releases and other project events.)</p><p>There is an ongoing debate in the free software world about
whether it is necessary to begin with running code, or whether a
project can benefit from being opened even during the
design/discussion stage.  I used to think starting with running code
was the most important factor, that it was what separated successful
projects from toys, and that serious developers would only be
attracted to software that did something concrete already.</p><p>This turned out not to be the case.  In the Subversion project,
we started with a design document, a core of interested and
well-connected developers, a lot of fanfare, and
<span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> running code at all.  To my complete surprise,
the project acquired active participants right from the beginning, and
by the time we did have something running, there were quite a few
volunteer developers already deeply involved.  Subversion is not the
only example; the Mozilla project was also launched without running
code, and is now a successful and popular web browser.</p><p>In the face of such evidence, I have to back away from the
assertion that running code is absolutely necessary for launching a
project.  Running code is still the best foundation for success, and a
good rule of thumb would be to wait until you have it before
announcing your project.  However, there may be circumstances where
announcing earlier makes sense.  I do think that at least a
well-developed design document, or else some sort of code framework,
is necessary&#8212;of course it may be revised based on public
feedback, but there has to be something concrete, something more
tangible than just good intentions, for people to sink their teeth
into.</p><p>Whenever you announce, don't expect a horde of volunteers to
join the project immediately afterward.  Usually, the result of
announcing is that you get a few casual inquiries, a few more people
join your mailing lists, and aside from that, everything continues
pretty much as before.  But over time, you will notice a gradual
increase in participation from both new code contributors and users.
Announcement is merely the planting of a seed.  It can take a long
time for the news to spread.  If the project consistently rewards
those who get involved, the news <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> spread,
though, because people want to share when they've found something
good.  If all goes well, the dynamics of exponential communications
networks will slowly transform the project into a complex community,
where you don't necessarily know everyone's name and can no longer
follow every single conversation.  The next chapters are about working
in that environment.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp6165072" href="#idp6165072" class="para">10</a>] </sup>We haven't gotten to the section on

kiedy decyzje mo&#380;na uzna&#263; za podj&#281;te, i tak dalej. Istotnym elementem
procesu parlamentarnego jest ustalenie, jak grupa korzysta ze swojego
systemu gromadzenia informacji. Niektóre uwagi s&#261; wpisywane "do stenogramu",
inne nie. Sam zapis mo&#380;e ulec zmianie, nie jest traktowany jako dos&#322;owny
&#347;lad tego, co si&#281; faktycznie wydarzy&#322;o, ale jako deklaracja tego, co
wydarzy&#322;o si&#281; wed&#322;ug <span class="emphasis"><em>decyzji</em></span> grupy. Taki zapis nie jest
jednorodny, dla ró&#380;nych celów przyjmuje ró&#380;n&#261; posta&#263;. Mog&#261; to by&#263; notatki z
poszczególnych spotka&#324;, zbiór notatek wszystkich spotka&#324;, podsumowania,
agendy i komentarze do nich, raporty komitetów, raporty od nieobecnych
korespondentów, listy zada&#324;, i tak dalej.</p><p>Tak naprawd&#281; Internet to nie pokój, wi&#281;c nie musimy matwi&#263; si&#281; o te
elementy procesu parlamentarnego, które zapewniaj&#261; cisz&#281;, gdy inni mówi&#261;.
Jednak gdy chodzi o techniki zarz&#261;dzania informacjami, dobrze prowadzone
projekty otwartego oprogramowania to "procedura parlamentarna na sterydach".
Jako &#380;e praktycznie ca&#322;a komunikacja w projektach wolnego oprogramowania
odbywa si&#281; na pi&#347;mie, stworzone zosta&#322;y skomplikowane systemy u&#322;atwiaj&#261;ce
przekazywanie i etykietowanie informacji, minimalizowanie powtórze&#324; i
niepotrzebnych rozbie&#380;no&#347;ci, przechowywanie i odzyskiwanie danych,
korygowanie z&#322;ych i przestarza&#322;ych informacji, &#322;&#261;czenie poszczególnych
informacji pomi&#281;dzy sob&#261;. Aktywni uczestnicy sami zdaj&#261; sobie spraw&#281; z
u&#380;yteczno&#347;ci tych technik, i potrafi&#261; poradzi&#263; sobie z nimi r&#281;cznie. Jednak
na d&#322;u&#380;sz&#261; met&#281; jedyn&#261; drog&#261; jest u&#380;ycie odpowiedniego oprogramowania. Je&#347;li
to tylko mo&#380;liwe, samo medium wymiany informacji powinno zapewnia&#263; jej
przekazywanie, etykietowanie czy rejestrowanie, i udost&#281;pnia&#263; informacje
ludziom w najdogodniejszej dla nich postaci. W praktyce interwencja
cz&#322;owieka w tym procesie wci&#261;&#380; b&#281;dzie czasem konieczna, a wi&#281;c samo
oprogramowanie powinno u&#322;atwia&#263; tak&#261; interwencj&#281;. Jednak w wi&#281;kszo&#347;ci
wypadków je&#347;li cz&#322;owiek odpowiednio opisze informacj&#281; wprowadzaj&#261;c j&#261; do
systemu, oprogramowanie powinno skorzysta&#263; z tych metadanych tak dobrze, jak
to tylko mo&#380;liwe.</p><p>Porady w tym rozdziale s&#261; mocno praktyczne, oparte na do&#347;wiadczeniach
z opisanym oprogramowaniem i ró&#380;nymi scenariuszami u&#380;ycia. Jednak g&#322;ównym
celem nie jest jedynie przekazanie pewnego zestawu technik. Chodzi tak&#380;e o
wskazanie (na wielu ma&#322;ych przyk&#322;adach) dobrego podej&#347;cia, który zach&#281;ci do
skutecznego zarz&#261;dzania informacjami w projekcie. To podej&#347;cie sk&#322;ada si&#281;
zarówno z umiej&#281;tno&#347;ci technicznych, jak i tych mi&#281;kkich. Umiej&#281;tno&#347;ci
techniczne s&#261; konieczne, poniewa&#380; oprogramowanie do zarz&#261;dzania informacjami
zawsze wymaga konfiguracji, a tak&#380;e pewnego wysi&#322;ku w utrzymaniu i
dostosowywaniu do nowych potrzeb (na przyk&#322;ad patrz dyskusja o tym, jak

niezb&#281;dne, poniewa&#380; ludzka spo&#322;eczno&#347;&#263; tak&#380;e wymaga opieki. Nie zawsze

zach&#281;cany, w odpowiednim czasie i w odpowiedni sposób, do dbania o porz&#261;dek
w informacjach projektu. Im wi&#281;ksze zaanga&#380;owanie uczestnika w projekt, tym

nie maj&#261; dobrych uk&#322;adów z administratorami), korzystanie z pola Reply-to
mo&#380;e by&#263; jedynym sposobem na podanie poprawnego adresu zwrotnego. Gdy taka
osoba wysy&#322;a wiadomo&#347;&#263; na list&#281;, na któr&#261; nie jest zapisana, warto&#347;&#263; pola

pole, odpowiedzi mog&#261; do niej w ogóle nie dotrze&#263;.</p><p>Drugi problem dotyczy oczekiwa&#324;, i moim zdaniem to najpowa&#380;niejszy
argument przeciwko modyfikowaniu pola Reply-to. Wi&#281;kszo&#347;&#263; do&#347;wiadczonych
u&#380;ytkowników poczty elektronicznej jest przyzwyczajona do dwóch podstawowych
rodzajów odpowiedzi: <em class="firstterm">"odpowiedz wszystkim"</em> i
<em class="firstterm">"odpowiedz autorowi"</em>. Wspó&#322;czesne oprogramowanie
pocztowe posiada osobne polecenia dla ka&#380;dej z tych akcji. U&#380;ytkownicy
spodziewaj&#261; si&#281;, &#380;e aby odpowiedzie&#263; wszystkim (a wi&#281;c tak&#380;e na list&#281;),
powinni wybra&#263; opcj&#281; "odpowiedz wszystkim", a &#380;eby odpowiedzie&#263; prywatnie
autorowi, powinni wybra&#263; "odpowiedz autorowi". Wprawdzie chcemy zach&#281;ca&#263;
ludzi do odpowiadania na list&#281;, zdarzaj&#261; si&#281; jednak sytuacje, w których
prywatna odpowied&#378; jest konieczna&#8212;na przyk&#322;ad, gdy chcemy wys&#322;a&#263;
autorowi wiadomo&#347;ci jakie&#347; niepubliczne informacje, które nie powinny
pojawi&#263; si&#281; na li&#347;cie.</p><p>Zastanówmy si&#281; teraz, co si&#281; stanie, gdy lista nadpisze pole Reply-to.
U&#380;ytkownik wybiera polecenie "odpowiedz autorowi", chc&#261;c odpowiedzie&#263;
prywatnie autorowi wiadomo&#347;ci. Spodziewa si&#281; takiego efektu, wi&#281;c by&#263; mo&#380;e
nie spojrzy uwa&#380;nie na pole odbiorcy nowej wiadomo&#347;ci. Nast&#281;pnie wprowadzi
prywatn&#261; i poufn&#261; tre&#347;&#263;, na przyk&#322;ad jak&#261;&#347; obra&#378;liw&#261; opini&#281; na temat jednej
z osób na li&#347;cie, i wy&#347;le wiadomo&#347;&#263;. Niespodziewanie chwil&#281; pó&#378;niej jego
wiadomo&#347;&#263; pojawia si&#281; <span class="emphasis"><em>na li&#347;cie dyskusyjnej!</em></span>
Faktycznie, w teorii powinien spojrze&#263; na pole odbiorcy i nie zak&#322;ada&#263; nic
na temat zawarto&#347;ci pola Reply-to. Jednak pole Reply-to prawie zawsze
ustawiane jest (najcz&#281;&#347;ciej automatycznie przez sam program pocztowy) na
adres prywatny nadawcy, i wielu u&#380;ytkowników poczty jest do tego
przyzwyczajonych. Gdy kto&#347; celowo ustawia pole Reply-to na jaki&#347; inny adres,
jak lista dyskusyjna, na ogó&#322; wspomina o tym w tre&#347;ci wiadomo&#347;ci, aby nikt
nie by&#322; tym zaskoczony.</p><p>Ze wzgl&#281;du na mo&#380;liwo&#347;&#263; takich nieprzewidzianych komplikacji, na ogó&#322;
konfiguruj&#281; oprogramowanie zarz&#261;dzaj&#261;ce list&#261; tak, aby nie rusza&#322;o nag&#322;ówka
Reply-to. To przyk&#322;ad sytuacji, w której u&#380;ycie technologii w celu
u&#322;atwienia komunikacji ma, a przynajmniej tak mi si&#281; zdaje, potencjanie
niebezpieczne efekty uboczne. Jednak druga strona debaty na tak&#380;e silne
argumenty. Którekolwiek rozwi&#261;zanie wybierzesz, na pewno od czasu do czasu
ludzie b&#281;d&#261; wysy&#322;ali wiadomo&#347;ci na list&#281; z pytaniem, dlaczego nie podj&#281;&#322;e&#347;
innej decyzji. To nie jest temat, który powinien by&#263; g&#322;ównym w&#261;tkiem na
li&#347;cie, wi&#281;c warto przygotowa&#263; sobie gotow&#261; odpowied&#378;, najlepiej tak&#261;, która

  email, but instead provide a URL to view the change on the web using
  the repository browsing system.  While it's good to provide the URL,
  so the change can be referred to later, it is also
  <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> important that the commit email include
  the diffs themselves.  Reading email is already part of people's
  routine, so if the content of the change is visible right there in
  the commit email, developers will review the commit on the spot,
  without leaving their mail reader.  If they have to click on a URL to
  review the change, most won't do it, because that requires a new
  action instead of a continuation of what they were already doing.
  Furthermore, if the reviewer wants to ask something about the
  change, it's vastly easier to hit reply-with-text and simply
  annotate the quoted diff than it is to visit a web page and
  laboriously cut-and-paste parts of the diff from web browser to
  email client.</p><p>(Of course, if the diff is huge, such as when a large body of
  new code has been added to the repository, then it makes sense to
  omit the diff and offer only the URL.  Most commit mailers can do
  this kind of limiting automatically.  If yours can't, then it's
  still better to include diffs, and live with the occasional huge
  email, than to leave the diffs off entirely.  Convenient reviewing
  and commenting is a cornerstone of cooperative development, much
  too important to do without.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The commit emails should set their Reply-to header
  to the regular development list, not the commit email list.  That
  is, when someone reviews a commit and writes a response, their
  response should be automatically directed toward the human
  development list, where technical issues are normally discussed.
  There are a few reasons for this.  First, you want to keep all
  technical discussion on one list, because that's where people expect
  it to happen, and because that way there's only one archive to
  search.  Second, there might be interested parties not subscribed to
  the commit email list.  Third, the commit email list advertises
  itself as a service for watching commits, not for watching commits
  <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> occasional technical discussions.  Those who
  subscribed to the commit email list did not sign up for anything but
  commit emails; sending them other material via that list would
  violate an implicit contract.  Fourth, people often write programs
  that read the commit email list and process the results (for
  display on a web page, for example).  Those programs are prepared to
  handle consistently-formatted commit emails, but not inconsistent
  human-written mails.</p><p>Note that this advice to set Reply-to does not contradict the
  recommendations in
  <a class="xref" href="#reply-to" title="Wielka debata o nag&#322;ówek Reply-to">&#8222;Wielka debata o nag&#322;ówek Reply-to&#8221;</a><span> earlier in
  this chapter</span>.  It's
  always okay for the <span class="emphasis"><em>sender</em></span> of a message to set
  Reply-to.  In this case, the sender is the version control system
  itself, and it sets Reply-to in order to indicate that the
  appropriate place for replies is the development mailing list, not
  the commit list.</p></li></ol></div><div class="sidebar" title="CIA: Another Change Publication Mechanism"><a name="cia"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>CIA: Another Change Publication Mechanism</b></p></div></div></div><p>Commit emails are not the only way to propagate change news.
Recently, another mechanism called CIA (<a class="ulink" href="http://cia.navi.cx/" target="_top">http://cia.navi.cx/</a>) has been developed.  CIA is a real-time
commit statistics aggregator and distributor.  The most popular use of
CIA is to send commit notifications to IRC channels, so that people
logged into those channels see the commits happening in real time.
Though of somewhat less technical utility than commit emails, since
observers might or might not be around when a commit notice pops up in
IRC, this technique is of immense <span class="emphasis"><em>social</em></span> utility.
People get the sense of being part of something alive and active, and
feel that they can see progress being made right before their
eyes.</p><p>The way it works is that you invoke the CIA notifier program
from your post-commit hook.  The notifier formats the commit
information into an XML message, and sends to a central server
(typically <code class="literal">cia.navi.cx</code>).  That server then
distributes the commit information to other forums.</p><p>CIA can also be configured to send out <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html" target="_top">RSS</a>
feeds.  See the documentation at <a class="ulink" href="http://cia.navi.cx/" target="_top">http://cia.navi.cx/</a>
for details.</p><p>To see an example of CIA in action, point your IRC
client at <code class="literal">irc.freenode.net</code>, channel
<code class="literal">#commits</code>.</p></div></div><div class="sect3" title="Use branches to avoid bottlenecks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="branches"></a>Use branches to avoid bottlenecks</h4></div></div></div><p>Non-expert version control users are sometimes a bit afraid of
branching and merging.  This is probably a side effect of CVS's
popularity: CVS's interface for branching and merging is somewhat
counterintuitive, so many people have learned to avoid those
operations entirely.</p><p>If you are among those people, resolve right now to conquer any
fears you may have and take the time to learn how to do branching and
merging.  They are not difficult operations, once you get used to
them, and they become increasingly important as a project acquires
more developers.</p><p>Branches are valuable because they turn a scarce
resource&#8212;working room in the project's code&#8212;into an
abundant one.  Normally, all developers work together in the same
sandbox, constructing the same castle.  When someone wants to add a
new drawbridge, but can't convince everyone else that it would be an
improvement, branching makes it possible for her to go to an isolated
corner and try it out.  If the effort succeeds, she can invite the
other developers to examine the result.  If everyone agrees that the
result is good, they can tell the version control system to move
("merge") the drawbridge from the branch castle over to the main
castle.</p><p>It's easy to see how this ability helps collaborative
development.  People need the freedom to try new things without
feeling like they're interfering with others' work.  Equally
importantly, there are times when code needs to be isolated from the
usual development churn, in order to get a bug fixed or a release
stabilized (see <a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">&#8222;Stabilizing a Release&#8221;</a> and
<a class="xref" href="#release-lines" title="Maintaining Multiple Release Lines">&#8222;Maintaining Multiple Release Lines&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Rozdzia&#322; 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Rozdzia&#322; 7, <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>) without worrying
about tracking a moving target.</p><p>Use branches liberally, and encourage others to use them.  But
also make sure that a given branch is only active for exactly as long
as needed.  Every active branch is a slight drain on the community's
attention.  Even those who are not working in a branch still maintain
a peripheral awareness of what's going on in it.  Such awareness is
desirable, of course, and commit emails should be sent out for branch
commits just as for any other commit.  But branches should not become
a mechanism for dividing the development community.  With rare
exceptions, the eventual goal of most branches should be to merge
their changes back into the main line and disappear.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Singularity of information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="vc-singularity"></a>Singularity of information</h4></div></div></div><p>Merging has an important corollary: never commit the same change
twice.  That is, a given change should enter the version control
system exactly once.  The revision (or set of revisions) in which the
change entered is its unique identifier from then on.  If it needs to
be applied to branches other than the one on which it entered, then it
should be merged from its original entry point to those other
destinations&#8212;as opposed to committing a textually identical
change, which would have the same effect in the code, but would make
accurate bookkeeping and release management impossible.</p><p>The practical effects of this advice differ from one version
control system to another.  In some systems, merges are special
events, fundamentally distinct from commits, and carry their own
metadata with them.  In others, the results of merges are committed
the same way other changes are committed, so the primary means of
distinguishing a "merge commit" from a "new change commit" is in the
log message.  In a merge's log message, don't repeat the log message
of the original change.  Instead, just indicate that this is a merge,
and give the identifying revision of the original change, with at most
a one-sentence summary of its effect.  If someone wants to see the
full log message, she should consult the original revision.</p><p>The reason it's important to avoid repeating the log message is
that log messages are sometimes edited after they've been committed.
If a change's log message were repeated at each merge destination,
then even if someone edited the original message, she'd still leave
all the repeats uncorrected&#8212;which would only cause confusion
down the road.</p><p>The same principle applies to reverting a change.  If a change
is withdrawn from the code, then the log message for the reversion
should merely state that some specific revision(s) is being reverted,
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> describe the actual code change that results
from the reversion, since the semantics of the change can be derived
by reading the original log message and change.  Of course, the
reversion's log message should also state the reason why the change is
being reverted, but it should not duplicate anything from the original
change's log message.  If possible, go back and edit the original
change's log message to point out that it was reverted.</p><p>All of the above implies that you should use a consistent syntax
for referring to revisions.  This is helpful not only in log messages,
but in emails, the bug tracker, and elsewhere.  If you're using
CVS, I suggest "<code class="literal">path/to/file/in/project/tree:REV</code>",
where REV is a CVS revision number such as "1.76".  If you're using
Subversion, the standard syntax for revision 1729 is "r1729" (file
paths are not needed because Subversion uses global revision numbers).
In other systems, there is usually a standard syntax for expressing
the changeset name.  Whatever the appropriate syntax is for your
system, encourage people to use it when referring to changes.
Consistent expression of change names makes project bookkeeping much
easier (as we will see in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a> and
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Rozdzia&#322; 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Rozdzia&#322; 7, <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a>), and since a lot of the
bookkeeping will be done by volunteers, it needs to be as easy as
possible.</p><p>See also

people can be allowed or disallowed from committing in specific
sub-areas of the repository.  Following the principle that when handed
a hammer, people start looking around for nails, many projects use
this feature with abandon, carefully granting people access to just
those areas where they have been approved to commit, and making sure
they can't commit anywhere else.  (See
<a class="xref" href="#committers" title="Prawo zapisu">&#8222;Prawo zapisu&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span> for how projects
decide who can commit where.)</p><p>There is probably little harm done by exercising such tight
control, but a more relaxed policy is fine too.  Some projects simply
use an honor system: when a person is granted commit access, even for
a sub-area of the repository, what they actually receive is a password
that allows them to commit anywhere in the project.  They're just
asked to keep their commits in their area.  Remember that there is no
real risk here: in an active project, all commits are reviewed anyway.
If someone commits where they're not supposed to, others will
notice it and say something.  If a change needs to be undone, that's
simple enough&#8212;everything's under version control anyway, so
just revert.</p><p>There are several advantages to the relaxed approach.  First, as
developers expand into other areas (which they usually will if they
stay with the project), there is no administrative overhead to
granting them wider privileges.  Once the decision is made, the person
can just start committing in the new area right away.</p><p>Second, expansion can be done in a more fine-grained manner.
Generally, a committer in area X who wants to expand to area Y will
start posting patches against Y and asking for review.  If someone who
already has commit access to area Y sees such a patch and approves of
it, they can just tell the submitter to commit the change directly
(mentioning the reviewer/approver's name in the log message, of
course).  That way, the commit will come from the person who actually
wrote the change, which is preferable from both an information
management standpoint and from a crediting standpoint.</p><p>Last, and perhaps most important, using the honor system
encourages an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect.  Giving someone
commit access to a subdomain is a statement about their technical
preparedness&#8212;it says: "We see you have expertise to make commits
in a certain domain, so go for it."  But imposing strict authorization
controls says: "Not only are we asserting a limit on your expertise,
we're also a bit suspicious about
your <span class="emphasis"><em>intentions</em></span>."  That's not the sort of
statement you want to make if you can avoid it.  Bringing someone into
the project as a committer is an opportunity to initiate them into a
circle of mutual trust.  A good way to do that is to give them more
power than they're supposed to use, then inform them that it's up to
them to stay within the stated limits.</p><p>The Subversion project has operated on the honor system way for
more than four years, with 33 full and 43 partial committers as of
this writing.  The only distinction the system actually enforces is
between committers and non-committers; further subdivisions are
maintained solely by humans.  Yet we've never had a problem with
someone deliberately committing outside their domain.  Once or twice
there's been an innocent misunderstanding about the extent of
someone's commit privileges, but it's always been resolved quickly and
amiably.</p><p>Obviously, in situations where self-policing is impractical, you
must rely on hard authorization controls.  But such situations are
rare.  Even when there are millions of lines of code and hundreds or
thousands of developers, a commit to any given code module should
still be reviewed by those who work on that module, and they can
recognize if someone committed there who wasn't supposed to.  If
regular commit review <span class="emphasis"><em>isn't</em></span> happening, then the
project has bigger problems to deal with than the authorization system
anyway.</p><p>In summary, don't spend too much time fiddling with the version
control authorization system, unless you have a specific reason to.  It
usually won't bring much tangible benefit, and there are advantages to
relying on human controls instead.</p><p>None of this should be taken to mean that the restrictions
themselves are unimportant, of course.  It would be bad for a project
to encourage people to commit in areas where they're not qualified.
Furthermore, in many projects, full (unrestricted) commit access has a
special status: it implies voting rights on project-wide questions.

discussed throughout this book.  Here I'll try to concentrate mainly
on setup and technical considerations, but to get to those, we have to
start with a policy question: exactly what kind of information should
be kept in a bug tracker?</p><p>The term <em class="firstterm">bug tracker</em> is misleading.  Bug
tracking systems are also frequently used to track new feature
requests, one-time tasks, unsolicited patches&#8212;really anything
that has distinct beginning and end states, with optional transition
states in between, and that accrues information over its lifetime.
For this reason, bug trackers are also called <em class="firstterm">issue
trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">defect trackers</em>,
<em class="firstterm">artifact trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">request
trackers</em>, <em class="firstterm">trouble ticket systems</em>,
etc.  See <a class="xref" href="#bug-trackers" title="Dodatek B. Free Bug Trackers">Dodatek B, <i>Free Bug Trackers</i></a> for a list of software.
</p><p>In this book, I'll continue to use "bug tracker" for the
software that does the tracking, because that's what most people call
it, but will use <em class="firstterm">issue</em> to refer to a single
item in the bug tracker's database.  This allows us to distinguish
between the behavior or misbehavior that the user encountered (that is,
the bug itself), and the tracker's <span class="emphasis"><em>record</em></span> of the
bug's discovery, diagnosis, and eventual resolution.  Keep in mind
that although most issues are about actual bugs, issues can be used to
track other kinds of tasks too.</p><p>The classic issue life cycle looks like this:

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Someone files the issue.  They provide a summary, an
            initial description (including a reproduction recipe, if
            applicable; see
            <a class="xref" href="#users-to-volunteers" title="Traktuj ka&#380;dego u&#380;ytkownika jako potencjalnego ochotnika">&#8222;Traktuj ka&#380;dego u&#380;ytkownika jako potencjalnego ochotnika&#8221;</a><span> in

            how to encourage good bug reports), and whatever other
            information the tracker asks for.  The person who files
            the issue may be totally unknown to the project&#8212;bug
            reports and feature requests are as likely to come from
            the user community as from the developers.</p><p>Once filed, the issue is in what's called an
            <em class="firstterm">open</em> state.  Because no action has
            been taken yet, some trackers also label it as
            <em class="firstterm">unverified</em> and/or
            <em class="firstterm">unstarted</em>.  It is not assigned to
            anyone; or, in some systems, it is assigned to a fake
            user to represent the lack of real assignation.  At this
            point, it is in a holding area: the issue has been
            recorded, but not yet integrated into the project's
            consciousness.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Others read the issue, add comments to it, and
            perhaps ask the original filer for clarification on some
            points.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets <em class="firstterm">reproduced</em>.
            This may be the most important moment in its
            life cycle.  Although the bug is not actually fixed yet,
            the fact that someone besides the original filer was able
            to make it happen proves that it is genuine, and, no less
            importantly, confirms to the original filer that they've
            contributed to the project by reporting a real bug.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets <em class="firstterm">diagnosed</em>: its
            cause is identified, and if possible, the effort required
            to fix it is estimated.  Make sure these things get
            recorded in the issue; if the person who diagnosed the
            bug suddenly has to step away from the project for a
            while (as can often happen with volunteer developers),
            someone else should be able to pick up where she left
            off.</p><p>In this stage, or sometimes the previous one, a
            developer may "take ownership" of the issue and
            <em class="firstterm">assign</em> it to herself (<a class="xref" href="#delegation-assignment" title="Wyra&#378;nie odró&#380;niaj pro&#347;by od wyznaczania">&#8222;Wyra&#378;nie odró&#380;niaj pro&#347;by od wyznaczania&#8221;</a><span> in

            examines the assignment process in more detail).  The issue's
            <em class="firstterm">priority</em> may also be set at this
            stage.  For example, if it is so severe that it should
            delay the next release, that fact needs to be identified
            early, and the tracker should have some way of noting
            it.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The issue gets scheduled for resolution.
            Scheduling doesn't necessarily mean naming a date by which
            it will be fixed.  Sometimes it just means deciding which
            future release (not necessarily the next one) the bug
            should be fixed by, or deciding that it need not block any
            particular release.  Scheduling may also be dispensed
            with, if the bug is quick to fix.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The bug gets fixed (or the task completed, or
            the patch applied, or whatever).  The change or set of
            changes that fixed it should be recorded in a comment in
            the issue, after which the issue is
            <em class="firstterm">closed</em> and/or marked as
            <em class="firstterm">resolved</em>.</p></li></ol></div><p>

</p><p>There are some common variations on this life cycle.  Sometimes
an issue is closed very soon after being filed, because it turns out
not to be a bug at all, but rather a misunderstanding on the part of
the user.  As a project acquires more users, more and more such
invalid issues will come in, and developers will close them with
increasingly short-tempered responses.  Try to guard against the
latter tendency.  It does no one any good, as the individual user in
each case is not responsible for all the previous invalid issues; the
statistical trend is visible only from the developers' point of view,
not the user's.  (In
<a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">&#8222;Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker&#8221;</a><span> later
in this chapter,</span> we'll look at
techniques for reducing the number of invalid issues.)  Also, if
different users are experiencing the same misunderstanding over and
over, it might mean that that aspect of the software needs to be
redesigned.  This sort of pattern is easiest to notice when there is
an issue manager monitoring the bug database; see
<a class="xref" href="#issue-manager" title="Mened&#380;er zg&#322;osze&#324;">&#8222;Mened&#380;er zg&#322;osze&#324;&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span>.</p><p>Another common life cycle variation is for the issue to be closed
as a <em class="firstterm">duplicate</em> soon after Step 1.  A duplicate
is when someone files an issue that's already known to the project.
Duplicates are not confined to open issues: it's possible for a bug to
come back after having been fixed (this is known as a
<em class="firstterm">regression</em>), in which case the preferred course
is usually to reopen the original issue and close any new reports as
duplicates of the original one.  The bug tracking system should keep
track of this relationship bidirectionally, so that reproduction
information in the duplicates is available to the original issue, and
vice versa.</p><p>A third variation is for the developers to close the issue,
thinking they have fixed it, only to have the original reporter reject
the fix and reopen it.  This is usually because the developers simply
don't have access to the environment necessary to reproduce the bug,
or because they didn't test the fix using the exact same reproduction
recipe as the reporter.</p><p>Aside from these variations, there may be other small details of
the life cycle that vary depending on the tracking software.  But the
basic shape is the same, and while the life cycle itself is not
specific to open source software, it has implications for how open
source projects use their bug trackers.</p><p>As Step 1 implies, the tracker is as much a public face of the
project as the mailing lists or web pages.  Anyone may file an issue,
anyone may look at an issue, and anyone may browse the list of currently
open issues.  It follows that you never know how many people are
waiting to see progress on a given issue.  While the size and skill of
the development community constrains the rate at which issues can be
resolved, the project should at least try to acknowledge each issue the
moment it appears.  Even if the issue lingers for a while, a response
encourages the reporter to stay involved, because she feels that a
human has registered what she has done (remember that filing an
issue usually involves more effort than, say, posting an email).
Furthermore, once an issue is seen by a developer, it enters the
project's consciousness, in the sense that that developer can be on
the lookout for other instances of the issue, can talk about it with
other developers, etc.</p><p>The need for timely reactions implies two things:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The tracker must be connected to a mailing list, such that
    every change to an issue, including its initial filing, causes a
    mail to go out describing what happened.  This mailing list
    is usually different from the regular development list, since not
    all developers may want to receive automated bug mails, but (just
    as with commit mails) the Reply-to header should be set to the
    development mailing list.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The form for filing issues should capture the reporter's
    email address, so she can be contacted for more information.
    (However, it should not <span class="emphasis"><em>require</em></span> the
    reporter's email address, as some people prefer to report issues
    anonymously.  See
    <a class="xref" href="#anonymity" title="Anonymity and involvement">&#8222;Anonymity and involvement&#8221;</a><span> later
    in this chapter</span> for more on the importance of
    anonymity.)</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><div class="sect2" title="Interaction with Mailing Lists"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bug-tracker-mailing-list-interaction"></a>Interaction with Mailing Lists</h3></div></div></div><p>Make sure the bug tracker doesn't turn into a discussion forum.
Although it is important to maintain a human presence in the bug
tracker, it is not fundamentally suited to real-time discussion.
Think of it rather as an archiver, a way to organize facts and
references to other discussions, primarily those that take place on
mailing lists.</p><p>There are two reasons to make this distinction.  First, the bug
tracker is more cumbersome to use than the mailing lists (or than
real-time chat forums, for that matter).  This is not because bug
trackers have bad user interface design, it's just that their
interfaces were designed for capturing and presenting discrete states,
not free-flowing discussions.  Second, not everyone who should be
involved in discussing a given issue is necessarily watching the bug
tracker.  Part of good issue management (see
<a class="xref" href="#share-management" title="Rozdzielaj zarówno zadania techniczne jak i kierownicze">&#8222;Rozdzielaj zarówno zadania techniczne jak i kierownicze&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span>) is to make sure
each issue is brought to the right peoples' attention, rather than
requiring every developer to monitor all issues.  In
<a class="xref" href="#bug-tracker-usage" title="No Conversations in the Bug Tracker">&#8222;No Conversations in the Bug Tracker&#8221;</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a>,</span> we'll look at ways to make
sure people don't accidentally siphon discussions out of appropriate
forums and into the bug tracker.</p><p>Some bug trackers can monitor mailing lists and automatically
log all emails that are about a known issue.  Typically they do this
by recognizing the issue's identifying number in the subject line of
the mail, as part of a special string; developers learn to include
these strings in their mails to attract the tracker's notice.  The bug
tracker may either save the entire email, or (even better) just record
a link to the mail in the regular mailing list archive.  Either way,
this is a very useful feature; if your tracker has it, make sure
both to turn it on and to remind people to take advantage of
it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bug-filtering"></a>Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker</h3></div></div></div><p>Most issue databases eventually suffer from the same problem: a
crushing load of duplicate or invalid issues filed by well-meaning but
inexperienced or ill-informed users.  The first step in combatting
this trend is usually to put a prominent notice on the front page of
the bug tracker, explaining how to tell if a bug is really a bug, how
to search to see if it's already been filed, and finally, how to
effectively report it if one still thinks it's a new bug.</p><p>This will reduce the noise level for a while, but as the number
of users increases, the problem will eventually come back.  No
individual user can be blamed for it.  Each one is just trying to
contribute to the project's well-being, and even if their first bug
report isn't helpful, you still want to encourage them to stay
involved and file better issues in the future.  In the meantime,
though, the project needs to keep the issue database as free of junk
as possible.</p><p>The two things that will do the most to prevent this problem
are: making sure there are people watching the bug tracker who have
enough knowledge to close issues as invalid or duplicates the moment
they come in, and requiring (or strongly encouraging) users to confirm
their bugs with other people before filing them in the tracker.</p><p>The first technique seems to be used universally.  Even projects
with huge issue databases (say, the Debian bug tracker at
<a class="ulink" href="http://bugs.debian.org/" target="_top">http://bugs.debian.org/</a>, which contained 315,929 issues
as of this writing) still arrange things so that
<span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> sees each issue that comes in.  It may be
a different person depending on the category of the issue.  For
example, the Debian project is a collection of software packages, so
Debian automatically routes each issue to the appropriate package
maintainers.  Of course, users can sometimes misidentify an issue's
category, with the result that the issue is sent to the wrong person
initially, who may then have to reroute it.  However, the important
thing is that the burden is still shared&#8212;whether the user
guesses right or wrong when filing, issue watching is still
distributed more or less evenly among the developers, so each issue is
able to receive a timely response.</p><p>The second technique is less widespread, probably because it's
harder to automate.  The essential idea is that every new issue gets
"buddied" into the database.  When a user thinks he's found a problem,
he is asked to describe it on one of the mailing lists, or in an IRC
channel, and get confirmation from someone that it is indeed a bug.
Bringing in that second pair of eyes early can prevent a lot of
spurious reports.  Sometimes the second party is able to identify that
the behavior is not a bug, or is fixed in recent releases.  Or she may
be familiar with the symptoms from a previous issue, and can prevent a
duplicate filing by pointing the user to the older issue.  Often it's
enough just to ask the user "Did you search the bug tracker to see if
it's already been reported?"  Many people simply don't think of that,
yet are happy to do the search once they know someone's
<span class="emphasis"><em>expecting</em></span> them to.</p><p>The buddy system can really keep the issue database clean, but
it has some disadvantages too.  Many people will file solo anyway,
either through not seeing, or through disregarding, the instructions
to find a buddy for new issues.  Thus it is still necessary for
volunteers to watch the issue database.  Furthermore, because most new
reporters don't understand how difficult the task of maintaining the
issue database is, it's not fair to chide them too harshly for
ignoring the guidelines.  Thus the volunteers must be vigilant, and
yet exercise restraint in how they bounce unbuddied issues back to
their reporters.  The goal is to train each reporter to use the
buddying system in the future, so that there is an ever-growing pool
of people who understand the issue-filtering system.  On seeing an
unbuddied issue, the ideal steps are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Immediately respond to the issue, politely thanking the user
          for filing, but pointing them to the buddying guidelines
          (which should, of course, be prominently posted on the web
          site).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the issue is clearly valid and not a duplicate, approve it
          anyway, and start it down the normal life cycle.  After all,
          the reporter's now been informed about buddying, so there's
          no point wasting the work done so far by closing a valid
          issue.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Otherwise, if the issue is not clearly valid, close it, but
          ask the reporter to reopen it if they get confirmation from
          a buddy.   When they do, they should put a reference to the
          confirmation thread (e.g., a URL into the mailing list
          archives).</p></li></ol></div><p>Remember that although this system will improve the signal/noise
ratio in the issue database over time, it will never completely stop
the misfilings.  The only way to prevent misfilings entirely is to
close off the bug tracker to everyone but developers&#8212;a cure that
is almost always worse than the disease.  It's better to accept that
cleaning out invalid issues will always be part of the project's
routine maintenance, and to try to get as many people as possible to
help.</p><p>See also

example, one channel for installation problems, another for usage
questions, another for development chat, etc. (<a class="xref" href="#growth" title="Handling Growth">&#8222;Handling Growth&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span> discusses and how to
divide into multiple channels).  When your project is young, there
should only be one channel, with everyone talking together.  Later, as
the user-to-developer ratio increases, separate channels may become
necessary.</p><p>How will people know all the available channels, let alone which
channel to talk in?  And when they talk, how will they know what the
local conventions are?</p><p>The answer is to tell them by setting the <em class="firstterm">channel
topic</em>.<sup>[<a name="idp6886992" href="#ftn.idp6886992" class="footnote">20</a>]</sup>  The channel topic is a brief
message each user sees when they first enter the channel.  It gives
quick guidance to newcomers, and pointers to further information.  For
example:</p><pre class="screen">
You are now talking on #svn

Topic for #svn is Forum for Subversion user questions, see also
http://subversion.tigris.org/. || Development discussion happens in
#svn-dev. || Please don't paste long transcripts here, instead use
a pastebin site like http://pastebin.ca/. || NEWS: Subversion 1.1.0
is released, see http://svn110.notlong.com/ for details.
</pre><p>That's terse, but it tells newcomers what they need to know.  It
says exactly what the channel is for, gives the project home page (in
case someone wanders into the channel without having first been to the
project web site), mentions a related channel, and gives some guidance
about pasting.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Paste Sites"><a name="paste-sites"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Paste Sites</b></p></div></div></div><p>An IRC channel is a shared space: everyone can see what everyone
else is saying.  Normally, this is a good thing, as it allows people
to jump into a conversation when they think they have something to
contribute, and allows spectators to learn by watching.  But it
becomes problematic when someone has to provide a large quantity of
information at once, such as a debugging session transcript, because
pasting too many lines of output into the channel will disrupt other
conversations.</p><p>The solution is to use one of the
<em class="firstterm">pastebin</em> or <em class="firstterm">pastebot</em>
sites.  When requesting a large amount of data from someone, ask them
not to paste it into the channel, but instead to go to (for example)
<a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.ca/" target="_top">http://pastebin.ca/</a>, paste their data into the form
there, and tell the resulting new URL to the IRC channel.  Anyone can
then visit the URL and view the data.</p><p>There are a number of free paste sites available now, too many
for a comprehensive list, but here are some of the ones I've seen used:

a so-called <em class="firstterm">bot</em>, that is capable of storing and
regurgitating information in response to specific commands.
Typically, the bot is addressed just like any other member of the
channel, that is, the commands are delivered by "speaking to" the bot.
For example:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; ayita: learn diff-cmd = http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  Thanks!
</pre><p>That told the bot (who is logged into the channel as ayita) to
remember a certain URL as the answer to the query "diff-cmd".  Now we
can address ayita, asking the bot to tell another user about
diff-cmd:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; ayita: tell jrandom about diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  jrandom: http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre><p>The same thing can be accomplished via a convenient shorthand:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; !a jrandom diff-cmd
&lt;ayita&gt;  jrandom: http://subversion.tigris.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre><p>The exact command set and behaviors differ from bot to bot.  The
above example is with <code class="literal">ayita</code>
(<a class="ulink" href="http://hix.nu/svn-public/alexis/trunk/" target="_top">http://hix.nu/svn-public/alexis/trunk/</a>), of which
there is usually an instance running in <code class="literal">#svn</code> at
freenode.  Other bots include Dancer
(<a class="ulink" href="http://dancer.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://dancer.sourceforge.net/</a>) and Supybot
(<a class="ulink" href="http://supybot.com/" target="_top">http://supybot.com/</a>).  Note that no special server
privileges are required to run a bot.  A bot is a client program;
anyone can set one up and direct it to listen to a particular
server/channel.</p><p>If your channel tends to get the same questions over and over,
I highly recommend setting up a bot.  Only a small percentage of
channel users will acquire the expertise needed to manipulate the bot,
but those users will answer a disproportionately high percentage of
questions, because the bot enables them to respond so much more
efficiently.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Archiving IRC"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="irc-archiving"></a>Archiving IRC</h3></div></div></div><p>Although it is possible to archive everything that happens in an
IRC channel, it's not necessarily expected.  IRC conversations may be
nominally public, but many people think of them as informal,
semi-private conversations.  Users may be careless with grammar, and
often express opinions (for example, about other software or other
programmers) that they wouldn't want preserved forever in an online
archive.</p><p>Of course, there will sometimes be <span class="emphasis"><em>excerpts</em></span>
that should be preserved, and that's fine.  Most IRC clients can log a
conversation to a file at the user's request, or failing that, one can
always just cut and paste the conversation from IRC into a more
permanent forum (most often the bug tracker).  But indiscriminate
logging may make some users uneasy.  If you do archive everything,
make sure you state so clearly in the channel topic, and give a URL to
the archive.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Wikis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="wikis"></a>Wikis</h2></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">wiki</em> is a web site that allows any
visitor to edit or extend its content; the term "wiki" (from a
Hawaiian word meaning "quick" or "super-fast") is also used to refer
to the software that enables such editing.  Wikis were invented in
1995, but their popularity has really started to take off since 2000
or 2001, boosted partly by the success of Wikipedia (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.wikipedia.org/" target="_top">http://www.wikipedia.org/</a>), a wiki-based free-content
encyclopedia.  Think of a wiki as falling somewhere between IRC and
web pages: wikis don't happen in realtime, so people get a chance to
ponder and polish their contributions, but they are also very easy to
add to, involving less interface overhead than editing a regular web
page.</p><p>Wikis are not yet standard equipment for open source projects,
but they probably will be soon.  As they are relatively new
technology, and people are still experimenting with different ways of
using them, I will just offer a few words of caution here&#8212;at
this stage, it's easier to analyze misuses of wikis than to analyze
their successes.</p><p>If you decide to run a wiki, put a lot of effort into having a
clear page organization and pleasing visual layout, so that visitors
(i.e., potential editors) will instinctively know how to fit in their
contributions.  Equally important, post those standards on the wiki
itself, so people have somewhere to go for guidance.  Too often, wiki
administrators fall victim to the fantasy that because hordes of
visitors are individually adding high quality content to the site,
the sum of all these contributions must therefore also be of high
quality.  That's not how web sites work.  Each individual page or
paragraph may be good when considered by itself, but it will not be
good if embedded in a disorganized or confusing whole.  Too often,
wikis suffer from:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Lack of navigational principles.</strong></span>
     A well-organized web site makes visitors feel like they know
     where they are at any time.  For example, if the pages are
     well-designed, people can intuitively tell the difference
     between a "table of contents" region and a "content" region.
     Contributors to a wiki will respect such differences too, but
     only if the differences are present to begin with.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Duplication of information.</strong></span>
     Wikis frequently end up with different pages saying similar
     things, because the individual contributors did not notice the
     duplications.  This can be partly a consequence of the lack of
     navigational principles noted above, in that people may not find
     the duplicate content if it is not where they expect it to
     be.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Inconsistent target audience.</strong></span>
     To some degree this problem is inevitable when there are so many
     authors, but it can be lessened if there are written guidelines
     about how to create new content.  It also helps to aggressively
     edit new contributions at the beginning, as an example, so that
     the standards start to sink in.</p></li></ul></div><p>The common solution to all these problems is the same: have
editorial standards, and demonstrate them not only by posting them,
but by editing pages to adhere to them.  In general, wikis will
amplify any failings in their original material, since contributors
imitate whatever patterns they see in front of them.  Don't just
set up the wiki and hope everything falls into place.  You must also
prime it with well-written content, so people have a template to
follow.</p><p>The shining example of a well-run wiki is Wikipedia, though this
may be partly 
because the content (encyclopedia entries) is naturally well-suited to
the wiki format.  But if you examine Wikipedia closely, you'll see
that its administrators laid a <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> thorough
foundation for cooperation.  There is extensive documentation on how
to write new entries, how to maintain an appropriate point of view,
what sorts of edits to make, what edits to avoid, a dispute resolution
process for contested edits (involving several stages, including
eventual arbitration), and so forth.  They also have authorization
controls, so that if a page is the target of repeated inappropriate
edits, they can lock it down until the problem is resolved.  In other
words, they didn't just throw some templates onto a web site and hope
for the best.  Wikipedia works because its founders thought carefully
about how to get thousands of strangers to tailor their writing to a
common vision.  While you may not need the same level of preparedness
to run a wiki for a free software project, the spirit is worth
emulating.</p><p>For more information about wikis, see

wiki remains alive and well, and contains a lot of discussion about

from a technical point of view: setting up a web server and writing
web pages are fairly simple tasks, and most of the important things to
say about layout and arrangement were covered in the previous chapter.
The web site's main function is to present a clear and welcoming
overview of the project, and to bind together the other tools (the
version control system, bug tracker, etc.).  If you don't have the
expertise to set up a web server yourself, it's usually not hard to
find someone who does and is willing to help out.  Nonetheless, to
save time and effort, people often prefer to use one of the canned
hosting sites.</p><div class="sect2" title="Canned Hosting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting"></a>Canned Hosting</h3></div></div></div><p>There are two main advantages to using a canned site.  The first
is server capacity and bandwidth: their servers are beefy boxes sitting
on really fat pipes.  No matter how successful your project gets,
you're not going to run out of disk space or swamp the network
connection.  The second advantage is simplicity.  They have already
chosen a bug tracker, a version control system, a mailing list manager,
an archiver, and everything else you need to run a site.  They've
configured the tools, and are taking care of backups for all the data
stored in the tools.  You don't need to make many decisions.  All you
have to do is fill in a form, press a button, and suddenly you've got
a project web site.</p><p>These are pretty significant benefits.  The disadvantage, of
course, is that you must accept <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> choices and
configurations, even if something different would be better for your
project.  Usually canned sites are adjustable within certain narrow
parameters, but you will never get the fine-grained control you would
have if you set up the site yourself and had full administrative
access to the server.</p><p>A perfect example of this is the handling of generated files.
Certain project web pages may be generated files&#8212;for example,
there are systems for keeping FAQ data in an easy-to-edit master
format, from which HTML, PDF, and other presentation formats can be
generated.  As explained in
<a class="xref" href="#version-everything" title="Wersjonuj wszystko">&#8222;Wersjonuj wszystko&#8221;</a><span>
earlier in this chapter</span>,
you wouldn't want to version the generated formats, only the master
file.  But when your web site is hosted on someone else's server, it
may be impossible to set up a custom hook to regenerate the online
HTML version of the FAQ whenever the master file is changed.  The only
workaround is to version the generated formats too, so that they show
up on the web site.</p><p>There can be larger consequences as well.  You may not have as
much control over presentation as you would wish.  Some of the canned
hosting sites allow you to customize your web pages, but the site's
default layout usually ends up showing through in various awkward
ways.  For example, some projects that host themselves at SourceForge
have completely customized home pages, but still point developers to
their "SourceForge page" for more information.  The SourceForge page
is what would be the project's home page, had the project not used a
custom home page.  The SourceForge page has links to the bug tracker,
the CVS repository, downloads, etc.  Unfortunately, a SourceForge page
also contains a great deal of extraneous noise.  The top is a banner
ad, often an animated image.  The left side is a vertical arrangement
of links of little relevance to someone interested in the project.
The right side is often another advertisement.  Only the center of the
page is devoted to truly project-specific material, and even that is
arranged in a confusing way that often makes visitors unsure of what
to click on next.</p><p>Behind every individual aspect of SourceForge's design, there is
no doubt a good reason&#8212;good from SourceForge's point of view,
such as the advertisements.  But from an individual project's point of
view, the result can be a less-than-ideal web page.  I don't mean to
pick on SourceForge; similar concerns apply to many of the canned
hosting sites.  The point is that there's a tradeoff.  You get relief
from the technical burdens of running a project site, but only at the
price of accepting someone else's way of running it.</p><p>Only you can decide whether canned hosting is best for your
project.  If you choose a canned site, leave open the option of
switching to your own servers later, by using a custom domain name for
the project's "home address".  You can forward the URL to the canned
site, or have a fully customized home page at the public URL and hand
users off to the canned site for sophisticated functionality.  Just
make sure to arrange things such that if you later decide to use a
different hosting solution, the project's address doesn't need to
change.</p><div class="sect3" title="Choosing a canned hosting site"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting-choosing"></a>Choosing a canned hosting site</h4></div></div></div><p>The largest and most well-known hosting site is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">SourceForge</a>.  Two other
sites providing the same or similar services are <a class="ulink" href="http://savannah.gnu.org/" target="_top">savannah.gnu.org</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.berlios.de/" target="_top">BerliOS.de</a>.  A few organizations,
such as the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_top">Apache Software
Foundation</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tigris.org/" target="_top">Tigris.org</a><sup>[<a name="idp6942736" href="#ftn.idp6942736" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup>, give free
hosting to open source projects that fit well with their missions and
their community of existing projects.</p><p>Haggen So did a thorough evaluation of various canned hosting
sites, as part of the research for his Ph.D. thesis,
<em class="citetitle">Construction of an Evaluation Model for Free/Open Source
Project Hosting (FOSPHost) sites</em>.  The results are at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/" target="_top">http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/</a>, and see especially
the very readable comparison chart at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/exhost.htm" target="_top">http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/exhost.htm</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Anonymity and involvement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="anonymity"></a>Anonymity and involvement</h4></div></div></div><p>A problem that is not strictly limited to the canned sites, but
is most often found there, is the abuse of user login functionality.
The functionality itself is simple enough: the site allows each
visitor to register herself with a username and password.  From
then on it keeps a profile for that user, and project administrators
can assign the user certain permissions, for example, the right to
commit to the repository.</p><p>This can be extremely useful, and in fact it's one of the prime
advantages of canned hosting.  The problem is that sometimes user
login ends up being required for tasks that ought to be permitted to
unregistered visitors, specifically the ability to file issues in the
bug tracker, and to comment on existing issues.  By requiring a
logged-in username for such actions, the project raises the
involvement bar for what should be quick, convenient tasks.  Of
course, one wants to be able to contact someone who's entered data
into the issue tracker, but having a field where she can enter her
email address (if she wants to) is sufficient.  If a new user spots a
bug and wants to report it, she'll only be annoyed at having to fill
out an account creation form before she can enter the bug into the
tracker.  She may simply decide not to file the bug at all.</p><p>The advantages of user management generally outweigh the
disadvantages.  But if you can choose which actions can be done
anonymously, make sure not only that <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
read-only actions are permitted to non-logged-in visitors, but also
some data entry actions, especially in the bug tracker and, if you
have them, wiki pages.</p></div></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp6417888" href="#idp6417888" class="para">12</a>] </sup>Z ksi&#261;&#380;ki <em class="citetitle">Mityczny

"How does it work?  What keeps a project running?  Who makes the
decisions?"  I'm always dissatisfied with bland responses about
meritocracy, the spirit of cooperation, code speaking for itself, etc.
The fact is, the question is not easy to answer.  Meritocracy,
cooperation, and running code are all part of it, but they do little
to explain how projects actually run on a day-to-day basis, and say
nothing about how conflicts are resolved.</p><p>This chapter tries to show the structural underpinnings
successful projects have in common.  I mean "successful" not just in
terms of technical quality, but also operational health and
survivability.  Operational health is the project's ongoing ability to
incorporate new code contributions and new developers, and to be
responsive to incoming bug reports.  Survivability is the project's
ability to exist independently of any individual participant or
sponsor&#8212;think of it as the likelihood that the project would
continue even if all of its founding members were to move on to other
things.  Technical success is not hard to achieve, but without a
robust developer base and social foundation, a project may be unable
to handle the growth that initial success brings, or the departure of
charismatic individuals.</p><p>There are various ways to achieve this kind of success.  Some
involve a formal governance structure, by which debates are resolved,
new developers are invited in (and sometimes out), new features
planned, and so on.  Others involve less formal structure, but more
conscious self-restraint, to produce an atmosphere of fairness that
people can rely on as a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> form
of governance.  Both ways lead to the same result: a sense of
institutional permanence, supported by habits and procedures that are
well understood by everyone who participates.  These features are even
more important in self-organizing systems than in centrally-controlled
ones, because in self-organizing systems, everyone is conscious that a
few bad apples can spoil the whole barrel, at least for a while.</p><div class="sect1" title="Forkability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="forkability"></a>Forkability</h2></div></div></div><p>The indispensable ingredient that binds developers together on a
free software project, and makes them willing to compromise when
necessary, is the code's <em class="firstterm">forkability</em>: the
ability of anyone to take a copy of the source code and use it to
start a competing project, known as a <em class="firstterm">fork</em>.
The paradoxical thing is that the <span class="emphasis"><em>possibility</em></span> of
forks is usually a much greater force in free software projects than
actual forks, which are very rare.  Because a fork is bad for everyone
(for reasons examined in detail in
<a class="xref" href="#forks" title="Rozwidlenia">&#8222;Rozwidlenia&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span>), the more serious
the threat of a fork becomes, the more willing people are to
compromise to avoid it.</p><p>Forks, or rather the potential for forks, are the reason there
are no true dictators in free software projects.  This may seem like a
surprising claim, considering how common it is to hear someone called
the "dictator" or "tyrant" in a given open source project.  But this
kind of tyranny is special, quite different from the conventional
understanding of the word.  Imagine a king whose subjects could copy
his entire kingdom at any time and move to the copy to rule as they
see fit.  Would not such a king govern very differently from one whose
subjects were bound to stay under his rule no matter what he
did?</p><p>This is why even projects that are not formally organized as
democracies are, in practice, democracies when it comes to important
decisions.  Replicability implies forkability; forkability implies
consensus.  It may well be that everyone is willing to defer to one
leader (the most famous example being Linus Torvalds in Linux kernel
development), but this is because they <span class="emphasis"><em>choose</em></span> to
do so, in an entirely non-cynical and non-sinister way.  The dictator
has no magical hold over the project.  A key property of all open
source licenses is that they do not give one party more power than any
other in deciding how the code can be changed or used.  If the dictator
were to suddenly start making bad decisions, there would be
restlessness, followed eventually by revolt and a fork.  Except, of
course, things rarely get that far, because the dictator compromises
first.</p><p>But just because forkability puts an upper limit on how much
power anyone can exert in a project doesn't mean there aren't
important differences in how projects are governed.  You don't want
every decision to come down to the last-resort question of who is
considering a fork.  That would get tiresome very quickly, and sap
energy away from real work.  The next two sections examine different
ways to organize projects such that most decisions go smoothly.  These
two examples are somewhat idealized extremes; many projects fall
somewhere along a continuum between them.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Benevolent Dictators"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="benevolent-dictator"></a>Benevolent Dictators</h2></div></div></div><p>The <em class="firstterm">benevolent dictator</em> model is exactly
what it sounds like: final decision-making authority rests with one
person, who, by virtue of personality and experience, is expected
to use it wisely.</p><p>Although "benevolent dictator" (or <em class="firstterm">BD</em>)is
the standard term for this role, it would be better to think of it as
"community-approved arbitrator" or "judge".  Generally, benevolent
dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even most of the
decisions.  It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise
to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project,
and anyway, quality developers won't stay around unless they have some
influence on the project's direction.  Therefore, benevolent dictators
commonly do not dictate much.  Instead, they let things work
themselves out through discussion and experimentation whenever
possible.  They participate in those discussions themselves, but as
regular developers, often deferring to an area maintainer who has more
expertise.  Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached,
and that most of the group <span class="emphasis"><em>wants</em></span> someone to guide
the decision so that development can move on, do they put their foot
down and say "This is the way it's going to be."  Reluctance to make
decisions by fiat is a trait shared by virtually all successful
benevolent dictators; it is one of the reasons they manage to keep the
role.</p><div class="sect2" title="Who Can Be a Good Benevolent Dictator?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="benevolent-dictator-qualifications"></a>Who Can Be a Good Benevolent Dictator?</h3></div></div></div><p>Being a BD requires a combination of traits.  It needs, first of
all, a well-honed sensitivity to one's own influence in the project,
which in turn brings self-restraint.  In the early stages of a
discussion, one should not express opinions and conclusions with so
much certainty that others feel like it's pointless to dissent.
People must be free to air ideas, even stupid ideas.  It is inevitable
that the BD will post a stupid idea from time to time too, of course,
and therefore the role also requires an ability to recognize and
acknowledge when one has made a bad decision&#8212;though this is
simply a trait that <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> good developer should
have, especially if she stays with the project a long time.  But the
difference is that the BD can afford to slip from time to time without
worrying about long-term damage to her credibility.  Developers with
less seniority may not feel so secure, so the BD should phrase
critiques or contrary decisions with some sensitivity for how much
weight her words carry, both technically and psychologically.</p><p>The BD does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to have the sharpest
technical skills of anyone in the project.  She must be skilled enough
to work on the code herself, and to understand and comment on any
change under consideration, but that's all.  The BD position is
neither acquired nor held by virtue of intimidating coding skills.
What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important is experience and overall
design sense&#8212;not necessarily the ability to produce good
design on demand, but the ability to recognize good design, whatever
its source.</p><p>It is common for the benevolent dictator to be a founder of the
project, but this is more a correlation than a cause.  The sorts of
qualities that make one able to successfully start a
project&#8212;technical competence, ability to persuade other people
to join, etc.&#8212;are exactly the qualities any BD would need.  And
of course, founders start out with a sort of automatic seniority,
which can often be enough to make benevolent dictatorship appear the
path of least resistance for all concerned.</p><p>Remember that the potential to fork goes both ways.  A BD can
fork a project just as easily as anyone else, and some have
occasionally done so, when they felt that the direction they wanted to
take the project was different from where the majority of other
developers wanted to go.  Because of forkability, it does not matter
whether the benevolent dictator has root (system administrator
privileges) on the project's main servers or not.  People sometimes
talk of server control as though it were the ultimate source of power
in a project, but in fact it is irrelevant.  The ability to add or
remove people's commit passwords on one particular server affects only
the copy of the project that resides on that server.  Prolonged abuse
of that power, whether by the BD or someone else, would simply lead to
development moving to a different server.</p></div><p>Whether your project should have a benevolent dictator, or would
run better with some less centralized system, largely depends on who
is available to fill the role.  As a general rule, if it's simply
obvious to everyone who should be the BD, then that's the way to go.
But if no candidate for BD is immediately obvious, then the project
should probably use a decentralized decision-making process, as
described in the next section.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Consensus-based Democracy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="consensus-democracy"></a>Consensus-based Democracy</h2></div></div></div><p>As projects get older, they tend to move away from the
benevolent dictatorship model and toward more openly democratic
systems.  This is not necessarily out of dissatisfaction with a
particular BD.  It's simply that group-based governance is more
"evolutionarily stable", to borrow a biological metaphor.  Whenever a
benevolent dictator steps down, or attempts to spread decision-making
responsibility more evenly, it is an opportunity for the group to
settle on a new, non-dictatorial system&#8212;establish a
constitution, as it were.  The group may not take this opportunity the
first time, or the second, but eventually they will; once they do,
the decision is unlikely ever to be reversed.  Common sense explains
why: if a group of N people were to vest one person with special
power, it would mean that N - 1 people were each agreeing to
decrease their individual influence.  People usually don't want to do
that.  Even if they did, the resulting dictatorship would still be
conditional: the group anointed the BD, clearly the group could depose
the BD.  Therefore, once a project has moved from leadership by a
charismatic individual to a more formal, group-based system, it rarely
moves back.</p><p>The details of how these systems work vary widely, but there are
two common elements: one, the group works by consensus most of the
time; two, there is a formal voting mechanism to fall back on when
consensus cannot be reached.</p><p><em class="firstterm">Consensus</em> merely means an agreement that
everyone is willing to live with.  It is not an ambiguous state: a
group has reached consensus on a given question when someone proposes
that consensus has been reached, and no one contradicts the assertion.
The person proposing consensus should, of course, state specifically
what the consensus is, and what actions would be taken in consequence
of it, if they're not obvious.</p><p>Most conversation in a project is on technical topics, such as
the right way to fix a certain bug, whether or not to add a feature,
how strictly to document interfaces, etc.  Consensus-based governance
works well because it blends seamlessly with the technical discussion
itself.  By the end of a discussion, there is often general agreement
on what course to take.  Someone will usually make a concluding post,
which is simultaneously a summary of what has been decided and an
implicit proposal of consensus.  This provides a last chance for
someone else to say "Wait, I didn't agree to that.  We need to hash
this out some more."</p><p>For small, uncontroversial decisions, the proposal of consensus
is implicit.  For example, when a developer spontaneously commits a
bugfix, the commit itself is a proposal of consensus: "I assume we all
agree that this bug needs to be fixed, and that this is the way to fix
it."  Of course, the developer does not actually say that; she just
commits the fix, and the others in the project do not bother to state
their agreement, because silence is consent.  If someone commits a
change that turns out <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have consensus, the
result is simply for the project to discuss the change as though it
had not already been committed.  The reason this works is the topic of
the next section.</p><div class="sect2" title="Version Control Means You Can Relax"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="version-control-relaxation"></a>Version Control Means You Can Relax</h3></div></div></div><p>The fact that the project's source code is kept under version
control means that most decisions can be easily unmade.  The most
common way this happens is that someone commits a change mistakenly
thinking everyone would be happy with it, only to be met with
objections after the fact.  It is typical for such objections to start
out with an obligatory apology for having missed out on prior
discussion, though this may be omitted if the objector finds no record
of such a discussion in the mailing list archives.  Either way, there
is no reason for the tone of the discussion to be different after the
change has been committed than before.  Any change can be reverted, at
least until dependent changes are introduced (i.e., new code that
would break if the original change were suddenly removed).  The
version control system gives the project a way to undo the effects of
bad or hasty judgement.  This, in turn, frees people to trust their
instincts about how much feedback is necessary before doing
something.</p><p>This also means that the process of establishing consensus need
not be very formal.  Most projects handle it by feel.  Minor changes
can go in with no discussion, or with minimal discussion followed by a
few nods of agreement.  For more significant changes, especially ones
with the potential to destabilize a lot of code, people should wait a
day or two before assuming there is consensus, the rationale being
that no one should be marginalized in an important conversation simply
because he didn't check email frequently enough.</p><p>Thus, when someone is confident he knows what needs to be done,
he should just go ahead and do it.  This applies not only to software
fixes, but to web site updates, documentation changes, and anything
else unlikely to be controversial.  Usually there will be only a few
instances where an action needs to be undone, and these can be handled on
a case-by-case basis.  Of course, one shouldn't encourage people to be
headstrong.  There is still a psychological difference between a
decision under discussion and one that has already taken effect, even
if it is technically reversible.  People always feel that momentum is
allied to action, and will be slightly more reluctant to revert a
change than to prevent it in the first place.  If a developer abuses
this fact by committing potentially controversial changes too quickly,
however, people can and should complain, and hold that developer to a
stricter standard until things improve.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="When Consensus Cannot Be Reached, Vote"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="voting"></a>When Consensus Cannot Be Reached, Vote</h3></div></div></div><p>Inevitably, some debates just won't consense.  When all other
means of breaking a deadlock fail, the solution is to vote.  But
before a vote can be taken, there must be a clear set of choices on
the ballot.  Here, again, the normal process of technical discussion
blends serendipitously with the project's decision-making procedures.
The kinds of questions that come to a vote often involve complex,
multifaceted issues.  In any such complex discussion, there are
usually one or two people playing the role of <em class="firstterm">honest
broker</em>: posting periodic summaries of the various
arguments and keeping track of where the core points of disagreement
(and agreement) lie.  These summaries help everyone measure how much
progress has been made, and remind everyone of what issues remain to
be addressed.  Those same summaries can serve as prototypes for a
ballot sheet, should a vote become necessary.  If the honest brokers
have been doing their job well, they will be able to credibly call for
a vote when the time comes, and the group will be willing to use a
ballot sheet based on their summary of the issues.  The brokers
themselves may be participants in the debate; it is not necessary for
them to remain above the fray, as long as they can understand and
fairly represent others' views, and not let their partisan sentiments
prevent them from summarizing the state of the debate in a neutral
fashion.</p><p>The actual content of the ballot is usually not controversial.
By the time matters reach a vote, the disagreement has usually boiled
down to a few key issues, with recognizable labels and brief
descriptions.  Occasionally a developer will object to the form of the
ballot itself.  Sometimes his concern is legitimate, for example,
that an important choice was left off or not described accurately.
But other times a developer may be merely trying to stave off the
inevitable, perhaps knowing that the vote probably won't go his way.

in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span> for how to deal with
this sort of obstructionism.</p><p>Remember to specify the voting system, as there are many
different kinds, and people might make wrong assumptions about which
procedure is being used.  A good choice in most cases is
<em class="firstterm">approval voting</em>, whereby each voter can vote
for as many of the choices on the ballot as he likes.  Approval
voting is simple to explain and to count, and unlike some other
methods, it only involves one round of voting.  See <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#List_of_systems" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_system#List_of_systems</a> for
more details about approval voting and other voting systems, but try
to avoid getting into a long debate about which voting system to use
(because, of course, you will then find yourself in a debate about
which voting system to use to decide the voting system!).  One reason
approval voting is a good choice is that it's very hard for anyone to
object to&#8212;it's about as fair as a voting system can be.</p><p>Finally, conduct votes in public.  There is no need for secrecy
or anonymity in a vote on matters that have been debated publicly
anyway.  Have each participant post her votes to the project mailing
list, so that any observer can tally and check the results for
herself, and so that everything is recorded in the archives.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="When To Vote"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="when-to-vote"></a>When To Vote</h3></div></div></div><p>The hardest thing about voting is determining when to do it.  In
general, taking a vote should be very rare&#8212;a last resort for
when all other options have failed.  Don't think of voting as a great
way to resolve debates.  It isn't.  It ends discussion, and thereby
ends creative thinking about the problem.  As long as discussion
continues, there is the possibility that someone will come up with a
new solution everyone likes.  This happens surprisingly often: a
lively debate can produce a new way of thinking about the problem, and
lead to a proposal that eventually satisfies everyone.  Even when no
new proposal arises, it's still usually better to broker a compromise
than to hold a vote.  After a compromise, everyone is a little bit
unhappy, whereas after a vote, some people are unhappy while others
are happy.  From a political standpoint, the former sitation is
preferable: at least each person can feel he extracted a price for his
unhappiness.  He may be dissatisfied, but so is everyone else.</p><p>Voting's main advantage is that it finally settles a question so
everyone can move on.  But it settles it by a head count, instead of
by rational dialogue leading everyone to the same conclusion.  The
more experienced people are with open source projects, the less eager
I find them to be to settle questions by vote.  Instead they will try
to explore previously unconsidered solutions, or compromise more
severely than they'd originally planned.  Various techniques are
available to prevent a premature vote.  The most obvious is simply to
say "I don't think we're ready for a vote yet," and explain why not.
Another is to ask for an informal (non-binding) show of hands.  If the
response clearly tends toward one side or another, this will make some
people suddenly more willing to compromise, obviating the need for a
formal vote.  But the most effective way is simply to offer a new
solution, or a new viewpoint on an old suggestion, so that people
re-engage with the issues instead of merely repeating the same
arguments.</p><p>In certain rare cases, everyone may agree that all the
compromise solutions are worse than any of the non-compromise ones.
When that happens, voting is less objectionable, both because it is
more likely to lead to a superior solution and because people will not
be overly unhappy no matter how it turns out.  Even then, the vote
should not be rushed.  The discussion leading up to a vote is what
educates the electorate, so stopping that discussion early can lower
the quality of the result.</p><p>(Note that this advice to be reluctant to call votes does not
apply to the change-inclusion voting described in
<a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">&#8222;Stabilizing a Release&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Rozdzia&#322; 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Rozdzia&#322; 7, <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>.  There, voting
is more of a communications mechanism, a means of registering one's
involvement in the change review process so that everyone can tell how
much review a given change has received.)</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Who Votes?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="electorate"></a>Who Votes?</h3></div></div></div><p>Having a voting system raises the question of electorate: who
gets to vote?  This has the potential to be a sensitive issue, because
it forces the project to officially recognize some people as being
more involved, or as having better judgement, than others.</p><p>The best solution is to simply take an existing distinction,
commit access, and attach voting privileges to it.  In projects that
offer both full and partial commit access, the question of whether
partial committers can vote largely depends on the process by which
partial commit access is granted.  If the project hands it out
liberally, for example as a way of maintaining many third-party
contributed tools in the repository, then it should be made clear that
partial commit access is really just about committing, not voting.
The reverse implication naturally holds as well: since full committers
<span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> have voting privileges, they must be chosen
not only as programmers, but as members of the electorate.  If someone
shows disruptive or obstructionist tendencies on the mailing list, the
group should be very cautious about making him a committer, even if
the person is technically skilled.</p><p>The voting system itself should be used to choose new
committers, both full and partial.  But here is one of the rare
instances where secrecy is appropriate.  You can't have votes about
potential committers posted to a public mailing list, because the
candidate's feelings (and reputation) could be hurt.  Instead, the
usual way is that an existing committer posts to a private mailing
list consisting only of the other committers, proposing that someone
be granted commit access.  The other committers speak their minds
freely, knowing the discussion is private.  Often there will be no
disagreement, and therefore no vote necessary.  After waiting a few
days to make sure every committer has had a chance to respond, the
proposer mails the candidate and offers him commit access.  If there
is disagreement, discussion ensues as for any other question, possibly
resulting in a vote.  For this process to be open and frank, the mere
fact that the discussion is taking place at all should be secret.  If
the person under consideration knew it was going on, and then were
never offered commit access, he could conclude that he had lost
the vote, and would likely feel hurt.  Of course, if someone
explicitly asks for commit access, then there is no choice but to
consider the proposal and explicitly accept or reject him.  If the
latter, then it should be done as politely as possible, with a clear
explanation: "We liked your patches, but haven't seen enough of them
yet," or "We appreciate all your patches, but they required
considerable adjustments before they could be applied, so we don't
feel comfortable giving you commit access yet.  We hope that this will
change over time, though."  Remember, what you're saying could come as
a blow, depending on the person's level of confidence.  Try to see it
from their point of view as you write the mail.</p><p>Because adding a new committer is more consequential than most
other one-time decisions, some projects have special requirements for
the vote.  For example, they may require that the proposal receive at
least <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> positive votes and no negative votes, or
that a supermajority vote in favor.  The exact parameters are not
important; the main idea is to get the group to be careful about
adding new committers.  Similar, or even stricter, special requirements
can apply to votes to <span class="emphasis"><em>remove</em></span> a committer, though
hopefully that will never be necessary.  See <a class="xref" href="#committers" title="Prawo zapisu">&#8222;Prawo zapisu&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span> for more on the
non-voting aspects of adding and removing committers.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Polls Versus Votes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="polls"></a>Polls Versus Votes</h3></div></div></div><p>For certain kinds of votes, it may be useful to expand the
electorate. For example, if the developers simply can't figure out
whether a given interface choice matches the way people actually use
the software, one solution is to ask to all the subscribers of the
project's mailing lists to vote.  These are really
<em class="firstterm">polls</em> rather than votes, but the developers may
choose to treat the result as binding.  As with any poll, be sure to
make it clear to the participants that there's a write-in option: if
someone thinks of a better option not offered in the poll questions,
her response may turn out to be the most important result of the
poll.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Vetoes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="veto"></a>Vetoes</h3></div></div></div><p>Some projects allow a special kind of vote known as a
<em class="firstterm">veto</em>.  A veto is a way for a developer to put a
halt to a hasty or ill-considered change, at least long enough for
everyone to discuss it more.  Think of a veto as somewhere between a
very strong objection and a filibuster.  Its exact meaning varies from
one project to another.  Some projects make it very difficult to
override a veto; others allow them to be overridden by regular
majority vote, perhaps after an enforced delay for more discussion.
Any veto should be accompanied by a thorough explanation; a veto
without such an explanation should be considered invalid on
arrival.</p><p>With vetoes comes the problem of veto abuse.  Sometimes
developers are too eager to raise the stakes by casting a veto, when
really all that was called for was more discussion.  You can prevent
veto abuse by being very reluctant to use vetoes yourself, and by
gently calling it out when someone else uses her veto too often.  If
necessary, you can also remind the group that vetoes are binding for
only as long as the group agrees they are&#8212;after all, if a
clear majority of developers wants X, then X is going to happen one
way or another.  Either the vetoing developer will back down, or the
group will decide to weaken the meaning of a veto.</p><p>You may see people write "-1" to express a veto.  This usage
comes from the Apache Software Foundation, which has a highly
structured voting and veto process, described at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html" target="_top">http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html</a>.  The Apache
standards have spread to other projects, and you will see their
conventions used to varying degrees in a lot of places in the open
source world.  Technically, "-1" does not always indicate a formal
veto even according to the Apache standards, but informally it is
usually taken to mean a veto, or at least a very strong
objection.</p><p>Like votes, vetoes can apply retroactively.  It's not okay to
object to a veto on the grounds that the change in question has
already been committed, or the action taken (unless it's something
irrevocable, like putting out a press release).  On the other hand, a
veto that arrives weeks or months late isn't likely to be taken very
seriously, nor should it be.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Writing It All Down"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="written-rules"></a>Writing It All Down</h2></div></div></div><p>At some point, the number of conventions and agreements floating
around in your project may become so great that you need to record it
somewhere.  In order to give such a document legitimacy, make it clear
that it is based on mailing list discussions and on agreements already
in effect.  As you compose it, refer to the relevant threads in the
mailing list archives, and whenever there's a point you're not sure
about, ask again.  The document should not contain any surprises: it
is not the source of the agreements, it is merely a description of
them.  Of course, if it is successful, people will start citing it as
a source of authority in itself, but that just means it reflects the
overall will of the group accurately.</p><p>This is the document alluded to in <a class="xref" href="#developer-guidelines" title="Developer Guidelines">&#8222;Developer Guidelines&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Rozdzia&#322; 2. Zaczynamy">Rozdzia&#322; 2, <i>Zaczynamy</i></a></span>.  Naturally, when the
project is very young, you will have to lay down guidelines without
the benefit of a long project history to draw on.  But as the
development community matures, you can adjust the language to reflect
the way things actually turn out.</p><p>Don't try to be comprehensive.  No document can capture
everything people need to know about participating in a project.  Many
of the conventions a project evolves remain forever unspoken, never
mentioned explicitly, yet adhered to by all.  Other things are simply
too obvious to be mentioned, and would only distract from important
but non-obvious material.  For example, there's no point writing
guidelines like "Be polite and respectful to others on the mailing
lists, and don't start flame wars," or "Write clean, readable bug-free
code."  Of course these things are desirable, but since there's no
conceivable universe in which they might <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
desirable, they are not worth mentioning.  If people are being rude on
the mailing list, or writing buggy code, they're not going to stop
just because the project guidelines said to.  Such situations need to
be dealt with as they arise, not by blanket admonitions to be good.
On the other hand, if the project has specific guidelines about
<span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> to write good code, such as rules about
documenting every API in a certain format, then those guidelines
should be written down as completely as possible.</p><p>A good way to determine what to include is to base the document
on the questions that newcomers ask most often, and on the complaints
experienced developers make most often.  This doesn't necessarily mean
it should turn into a FAQ sheet&#8212;it probably needs a more
coherent narrative structure than FAQs can offer.  But it should
follow the same reality-based principle of addressing the issues that
actually arise, rather than those you anticipate might arise.</p><p>If the project is a benevolent dictatorship, or has officers
endowed with special powers (president, chair, whatever), then the
document is also a good opportunity to codify succession procedures.
Sometimes this can be as simple as naming specific people as
replacements in case the BD suddenly leaves the project for any
reason.  Generally, if there is a BD, only the BD can get away with
naming a successor.  If there are elected officers, then the
nomination and election procedure that was used to choose them in the
first place should be described in the document.  If there was no
procedure originally, then get consensus on a procedure on the mailing
lists <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> writing about it.  People can
sometimes be touchy about hierarchical structures, so the subject
needs to be approached with sensitivity.</p><p>Perhaps the most important thing is to make it clear that the
rules can be reconsidered.  If the conventions described in the
document start to hamper the project, remind everyone that it is
supposed to be a living reflection of the group's intentions, not a
source of frustration and blockage.  If someone makes a habit of
inappropriately asking for rules to be reconsidered every time the
rules get in her way, you don't always need to debate it with
her&#8212;sometimes silence is the best tactic.  If other people
agree with the complaints, they'll chime in, and it will be obvious
that something needs to change.  If no one else agrees, then the
person won't get much response, and the rules will stay as they
are.</p><p>Two good examples of project guidelines are the Subversion
<code class="filename">hacking.html</code> file, at <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</a>, and the Apache
Software Foundation governance documents, at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html" target="_top">http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html" target="_top">http://www.apache.org/foundation/voting.html</a>.  The ASF is
really a collection of software projects, legally organized as a
nonprofit corporation, so its documents tend to describe governance
procedures more than development conventions.  They're still worth
reading, though, because they represent the accumulated experience of
a lot of open source projects.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" title="Rozdzia&#322; 5. Money"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="money"></a>Rozdzia&#322; 5.

environment.  It is aimed not only at developers who are paid to work
on free software projects, but also at their managers, who need to
understand the social dynamics of the development environment.  In the
sections that follow, the addressee ("you") is presumed to be either a
paid developer, or one who manages such developers.  The advice will
often be the same for both; when it's not, the intended audience will
be made clear from context.</p><p>Corporate funding of free software development is not a new
phenomenon.  A lot of development has always been informally
subsidized.  When a system administrator writes a network analysis
tool to help her do her job, then posts it online and gets bug fixes
and feature contributions from other system administrators, what's
happened is that an unofficial consortium has been formed.  The
consortium's funding comes from the sysadmins' salaries, and its
office space and network bandwidth are donated, albeit unknowingly, by
the organizations they work for.  Those organizations benefit from the
investment, of course, although they may not be institutionally aware
of it at first.</p><p>The difference today is that many of these efforts are being
formalized.  Corporations have become conscious of the benefits of
open source software, and started involving themselves more directly
in its development.  Developers too have come to expect that really
important projects will attract at least donations, and possibly even
long-term sponsors.  While the presence of money has not changed the
basic dynamics of free software development, it has greatly changed
the scale at which things happen, both in terms of the number of
developers and time-per-developer.  It has also had effects on how
projects are organized, and on how the parties involved in them
interact.  The issues are not merely about how the money is spent, or
how return on investment is measured.  They are also about management
and process: how can the hierarchical command structures of
corporations and the semi-decentralized volunteer communities of free
software projects work productively with each other?  Will they even
agree on what "productively" means?</p><p>Financial backing is, in general, welcomed by open source
development communities.  It can reduce a project's vulnerability to the
Forces of Chaos, which sweep away so many projects before they really
get off the ground, and therefore it can make people more willing to
give the software a chance&#8212;they feel they're investing their
time into something that will still be around six months from now.
After all, credibility is contagious, to a point.  When, say, IBM
backs an open source project, people pretty much assume the project
won't be allowed to fail, and their resultant willingness to devote
effort to it can make that a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>However, funding also brings a perception of control.  If not
handled carefully, money can divide a project into in-group and
out-group developers.  If the unpaid volunteers get the feeling that
design decisions or feature additions are simply available to the
highest bidder, they'll head off to a project that seems more like a
meritocracy and less like unpaid labor for someone else's benefit.
They may never complain overtly on the mailing lists.  Instead, there
will simply be less and less noise from external sources, as the
volunteers gradually stop trying to be taken seriously.  The buzz of
small-scale activity will continue, in the form of bug reports and
occasional small fixes.  But there won't be any large code
contributions or outside participation in design discussions.  People
sense what's expected of them, and live up (or down) to those
expectations.</p><p>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
can't buy influence.  It most certainly can.  The trick is that it
can't buy influence directly.  In a straightforward commercial
transaction, you trade money for what you want.  If you need a feature
added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and it gets done.  In an open
source project, it's not so simple.  You may sign a contract with some
developers, but they'd be fooling themselves&#8212;and you&#8212;if
they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be accepted by the
development community simply because you paid for it.  The work can
only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits into the
community's vision for the software.  You may have some say in that
vision, but you won't be the only voice.</p><p>So money can't purchase influence, but it can purchase things
that <span class="emphasis"><em>lead to</em></span> influence.  The most obvious example
is programmers.  If good programmers are hired, and they stick around
long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
any other member.  They will have a vote, or if there are many of
them, they will have a voting bloc.  If they are respected in the
project, they will have influence beyond just their votes.  There is
no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either.  After
all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
reason.  Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
else's.  It's just that the weight given to your company's goals will
be determined by its representatives' status in the project, not by
the company's size, budget, or business plan.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Types of Involvement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="types-of-involvement"></a>Types of Involvement</h2></div></div></div><p>There are many different reasons open source projects get
funded.  The items in this list aren't mutually exclusive; often a
project's financial backing will result from several, or even all, of
these motivations:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Sharing the burden</span></dt><dd><p>Separate organizations with related software needs often
     find themselves duplicating effort, either by redundantly writing
     similar code in-house, or by purchasing similar products from
     proprietary vendors.  When they realize what's going on, the
     organizations may pool their resources and create (or join) an
     open source project tailored to their needs.  The advantages are
     obvious: the costs of development are divided, but the benefits
     accrue to all.  Although this scenario seems most intuitive for
     nonprofits, it can make strategic sense even for for-profit
     competitors.</p><p>Examples: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openadapter.org/" target="_top">http://www.openadapter.org/</a>,

     more attractive by, particular open source programs, it is
     naturally in that company's interests to ensure those programs
     are actively maintained.</p><p>Example: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_top">CollabNet's</a> support of
     <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a> (disclaimer: that's
     my day job, but it's also a perfect example of this model).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Supporting hardware sales</span></dt><dd><p>The value of computers and computer components is directly
     related to the amount of software available for them.  Hardware
     vendors&#8212;not just whole-machine vendors, but also makers
     of peripheral devices and microchips&#8212;have found that
     having high-quality free software to run on their hardware is
     important to customers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Undermining a competitor</span></dt><dd><p>Sometimes companies support a particular open source
     project as a means of undermining a competitor's product, which
     may or may not be open source itself.  Eating away at a
     competitor's market share is usually not the sole reason for
     getting involved with an open source project, but it can be a
     factor.</p><p>Example: <a class="ulink" href="http://www.openoffice.org/" target="_top">http://www.openoffice.org/</a> (no,
     this isn't the only reason OpenOffice exists, but the software is
     at least partly a response to Microsoft Office).</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Marketing</span></dt><dd><p>Having your company associated with a popular open source
     application can be simply good brand management.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Dual-licensing</span></dt><dd><p><em class="firstterm">Dual-licensing</em> is the practice of
           offering software under a traditional proprietary license
           for customers who want to resell it as part of a
           proprietary application of their own, and simultaneously
           under a free license for those willing to use it under open
           source terms (see
           <a class="xref" href="#dual-licensing" title="Dual Licensing Schemes">&#8222;Dual Licensing Schemes&#8221;</a><span> in
           <a class="xref" href="#legal" title="Rozdzia&#322; 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Rozdzia&#322; 9, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a></span>).
           If the open source developer community is active, the
           software gets the benefits of wide-area debugging and
           development, yet the company still gets a royalty stream to
           support some full-time programmers.</p><p>Two well-known examples are <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mysql.com/" target="_top">MySQL</a>, makers of the
           database software of the same name, and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sleepycat.com/" target="_top">Sleepycat</a>, which
           offers distributions and support for the Berkeley Database.
           It's no coincidence that they're both database companies.
           Database software tends to be integrated into applications
           rather than marketed directly to users, so it's very
           well-suited to the dual-licensing model.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Donations</span></dt><dd><p>A widely-used project can sometimes get significant
           contributions, from both individuals and organizations,
           just by having an online donation button, or sometimes by
           selling branded merchandise such as coffee mugs, T-shirts,
           mousepads, etc.  A word of caution: if your project accepts
           donations, plan out how the money will be used
           <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> it comes in, and state the
           plans on the project's web site.  Discussions about how to
           allocate money tend to go a lot more smoothly when held
           before there's actual money to spend; and anyway, if there
           are significant disagreements, it's better to find that out
           while it's still academic.</p></dd></dl></div><p>A funder's business model is not the only factor in how it
relates to an open source community.  The historical relationship
between the two also matters: did the company start the project, or is
it joining an existing development effort?  In both cases, the funder
will have to earn credibility, but, not surprisingly, there's a bit
more earning to be done in the latter case.  The organization needs to
have clear goals with respect to the project.  Is the company trying
to keep a position of leadership, or simply trying to be one voice in
the community, to guide but not necessarily govern the project's
direction?  Or does it just want to have a couple of committers
around, able to fix customers' bugs and get the changes into the
public distribution without any fuss?</p><p>Keep these questions in mind as you read the guidelines that
follow.  They are meant to apply to any sort of organizational
involvement in a free software project, but every project is a human
environment, and therefore no two are exactly alike.  To some degree,
you will always have to play by ear, but following these principles
will increase the likelihood of things turning out the way you
want.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Hire for the Long Term"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="long-term-developers"></a>Hire for the Long Term</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're managing programmers on an open source project, keep
them there long enough that they acquire both technical and political
expertise&#8212;a couple of years, at a minimum.  Of course, no
project, whether open or closed-source, benefits from swapping
programmers in and out too often.  The need for a newcomer to learn
the ropes each time would be a deterrent in any environment.  But the
penalty is even stronger in open source projects, because outgoing
developers take with them not only their knowledge of the code, but
also their status in the community and the human relationships they
have made there.</p><p>The credibility a developer has accumulated cannot be
transferred.  To pick the most obvious example, an incoming developer
can't inherit commit access from an outgoing one (see
<a class="xref" href="#money-vs-love" title="Money Can't Buy You Love">&#8222;Money Can't Buy You Love&#8221;</a> later in this chapter), so if the
new developer doesn't already have commit access, he will have to
submit patches until he does.  But commit access is only the most
measurable manifestation of lost influence.  A long-time developer
also knows all the old arguments that have been hashed and rehashed on
the discussion lists.  A new developer, having no memory of those
conversations, may try to raise the topics again, leading to a loss of
credibility for your organization; the others might wonder "Can't
they remember anything?"  A new developer will also have no political
feel for the project's personalities, and will not be able to
influence development directions as quickly or as smoothly as one
who's been around a long time.</p><p>Train newcomers through a program of supervised engagement.  The
new developer should be in direct contact with the public development
community from the very first day, starting off with bug fixes and
cleanup tasks, so he can learn the code base and acquire a reputation
in the community, yet not spark any long and involved design
discussions.  All the while, one or more experienced developers should
be available for questioning, and should be reading every post the
newcomer makes to the development lists, even if they're in threads
that the experienced developers normally wouldn't pay attention to.
This will help the group spot potential rocks before the newcomer runs
aground.  Private, behind-the-scenes encouragement and pointers can
also help a lot, especially if the newcomer is not accustomed to
massively parallel peer review of his code.</p><p>When CollabNet hires a new developer to work on Subversion, we
sit down together and pick some open bugs for the new person to cut
his teeth on.  We'll discuss the technical outlines of the solutions,
and then assign at least one experienced developer to (publicly)
review the patch that the new developer will (also publicly) post.  We
typically don't even look at the patch before the main development
list sees it, although we could if there were some reason to.  The
important thing is that the new developer go through the process of
public review, learning the code base while simultaneously becoming
accustomed to receiving critiques from complete strangers.  But we
try to coordinate the timing so that our own review comes immediately
after the posting of the patch.  That way the first review the list
sees is ours, which can help set the tone for the others' reviews.  It
also contributes to the idea that this new person is to be taken
seriously: if others see that we're putting in the time to give
detailed reviews, with thorough explanations and references into the
archives where appropriate, they'll appreciate that a form of training
is going on, and that it probably signifies a long-term investment.
This can make them more positively disposed toward that developer, at
least to the degree of spending a little extra time answering
questions and reviewing patches.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Appear as Many, Not as One"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="appear-as-many"></a>Appear as Many, Not as One</h2></div></div></div><p>Your developers should strive to appear in the project's public
forums as individual participants, rather than as a monolithic
corporate presence.  This is not because there is some negative
connotation inherent in monolithic corporate presences (well, perhaps
there is, but that's not what this book is about).  Rather, it's
because individuals are the only sort of entity open source projects
are structurally equipped to deal with.  An individual contributor can
have discussions, submit patches, acquire credibility, vote, and so
forth.  A company cannot.</p><p>Furthermore, by behaving in a decentralized manner, you avoid
stimulating centralization of opposition.  Let your developers
disagree with each other on the mailing lists.  Encourage them to
review each other's code as often, and as publicly, as they would
anyone else's.  Discourage them from always voting as a bloc, because
if they do, others may start to feel that, just on general principles,
there should be an organized effort to keep them in check.</p><p>There's a difference between actually being decentralized and
simply striving to appear that way.  Under certain circumstances,
having your developers behave in concert can be quite useful, and they
should be prepared to coordinate behind the scenes when necessary.
For example, when making a proposal, having several people chime in
with agreement early on can help it along, by giving the impression of
a growing consensus.  Others will feel that the proposal has momentum,
and that if they were to object, they'd be stopping that momentum.
Thus, people will object only if they have a good reason to do so.
There's nothing wrong with orchestrating agreement like this, as long
as objections are still taken seriously.  The public manifestations of
a private agreement are no less sincere for having been coordinated
beforehand, and are not harmful as long as they are not used to
prejudicially snuff out opposing arguments.  Their purpose is merely
to inhibit the sort of people who like to object just to stay in
shape; see <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">&#8222;The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate&#8221;</a><span>

compromising business secrets.  If you want the project to acquire a
certain feature because, say, your customers have been clamoring for
it, just say so outright on the mailing lists.  If the customers wish
to remain anonymous, as is sometimes the case, then at least ask them
if they can be used as unnamed examples.  The more the public
development community knows about <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you want
what you want, the more comfortable they'll be with whatever you're
proposing.</p><p>This runs counter to the instinct&#8212;so easy to acquire, so
hard to shake off&#8212;that knowledge is power, and that the more
others know about your goals, the more control they have over you.
But that instinct would be wrong here.  By publicly advocating the
feature (or bugfix, or whatever it is), you have
<span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> laid your cards on the table.  The only
question now is whether you will succeed in guiding the community to
share your goal.  If you merely state that you want it, but can't
provide concrete examples of why, your argument is weak, and people
will start to suspect a hidden agenda.  But if you give just a few
real-world scenarios showing why the proposed feature is important,
that can have a dramatic effect on the debate.</p><p>To see why this is so, consider the alternative.  Too
frequently, debates about new features or new directions are long and
tiresome.  The arguments people advance often reduce to "I personally
want X," or the ever-popular "In my years of experience as a software
designer, X is extremely important to users / a useless frill that
will please no one."  Predictably, the absence of real-world usage
data neither shortens nor tempers such debates, but instead allows
them to drift farther and farther from any mooring in actual user
experience.  Without some countervailing force, the end result is as
likely as not to be determined by whoever was the most articulate, or
the most persistent, or the most senior.</p><p>As an organization with plentiful customer data available, you
have the opportunity to provide just such a countervailing force.  You
can be a conduit for information that might otherwise have no means of
reaching the development community.  The fact that that information
supports your desires is nothing to be embarrassed about.  Most
developers don't individually have very broad experience with how the
software they write is used.  Each developer uses the software in
her own idiosyncratic way; as far as other usage patterns go, she's
relying on intuition and guesswork, and deep down, she knows
this.  By providing credible data about a significant number of users,
you are giving the public development community something akin to
oxygen.  As long as you present it right, they will welcome it
enthusiastically, and it will propel things in the direction you want
to go.</p><p>The key, of course, is presenting it right.  It will never do to
insist that simply because you deal with a large number of users, and
because they need (or think they need) a given feature, therefore
your solution ought to be implemented.  Instead, you should focus your
initial posts on the problem, rather than on one particular solution.
Describe in great detail the experiences your customers are
encountering, offer as much analysis as you have available, and as
many reasonable solutions as you can think of.  When people start
speculating about the effectiveness of various solutions, you can
continue to draw on your data to support or refute what they say.  You
may have one particular solution in mind all along, but don't single
it out for special consideration at first.  This is not deception, it
is simply standard "honest broker" behavior.  After all, your true
goal is to solve the problem; a solution is merely a means to that
end.  If the solution you prefer really is superior, other developers
will recognize that on their own eventually&#8212;and then they will
get behind it of their own free will, which is much better than you
browbeating them into implementing it.  (There is also the possibility
that they will think of a better solution.)</p><p>This is not to say that you can't ever come out in favor of a
specific solution.  But you must have the patience to see the analysis
you've already done internally repeated on the public development
lists.  Don't post saying "Yes, we've been over all that here, but it
doesn't work for reasons A, B, and C.  When you get right down to it,
the only way to solve this is..."  The problem is not so much that it
sounds arrogant as that it gives the impression that you have
<span class="emphasis"><em>already</em></span> devoted some unknown (but, people will
presume, large) amount of analytical resources to the problem, behind
closed doors.  It makes it seem as though efforts have been going on,
and perhaps decisions made, that the public is not privy to, and that
is a recipe for resentment.</p><p>Naturally, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> know how much effort you've
devoted to the problem internally, and that knowledge is, in a way, a
disadvantage.  It puts your developers in a slightly different mental
space than everyone else on the mailing lists, reducing their ability
to see things from the point of view of those who haven't yet thought
about the problem as much.  The earlier you can get everyone else
thinking about things in the same terms as you do, the smaller this
distancing effect will be.  This logic applies not only to individual
technical situations, but to the broader mandate of making your goals
as clear as you can.  The unknown is always more destabilizing than
the known.  If people understand why you want what you want, they'll
feel comfortable talking to you even when they disagree.  If they
can't figure out what makes you tick, they'll assume the worst, at
least some of the time.</p><p>You won't be able to publicize everything, of course, and people
won't expect you to.  All organizations have secrets; perhaps
for-profits have more of them, but nonprofits have them too.  If you
must advocate a certain course, but can't reveal anything about why,
then simply offer the best arguments you can under that handicap, and
accept the fact that you may not have as much influence as you want in
the discussion.  This is one of the compromises you make in order to
have a development community not on your payroll.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Money Can't Buy You Love"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="money-vs-love"></a>Money Can't Buy You Love</h2></div></div></div><p>If you're a paid developer on a project, then set guidelines
early on about what the money can and cannot buy.  This does not mean
you need to post twice a day to the mailing lists reiterating your
noble and incorruptible nature.  It merely means that you should be on
the lookout for opportunities to defuse the tensions that
<span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be created by money.  You don't need to
start out assuming that the tensions are there; you do need to
demonstrate an awareness that they have the potential to arise.</p><p>A perfect example of this came up in the Subversion project.
Subversion was started in 2000 by <a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_top">CollabNet</a>, which has been the
project's primary funder since its inception, paying the salaries of
several developers (disclaimer: I'm one of them).  Soon after the
project began, we hired another developer, Mike Pilato, to join the
effort.  By then, coding had already started.  Although Subversion was
still very much in the early stages, it already had a development
community with a set of basic ground rules.</p><p>Mike's arrival raised an interesting question.  Subversion
already had a policy about how a new developer gets commit access.
First, he submits some patches to the development mailing list.  After
enough patches have gone by for the other committers to see that the
new contributor knows what he's doing, someone proposes that he just
commit directly (that proposal is private, as described in <a class="xref" href="#committers" title="Prawo zapisu">&#8222;Prawo zapisu&#8221;</a>).  Assuming the committers agree, one of
them mails the new developer and offers him direct commit access to
the project's repository.</p><p>CollabNet had hired Mike specifically to work on Subversion.
Among those who already knew him, there was no doubt about his coding
skills or his readiness to work on the project.  Furthermore, the
volunteer developers had a very good relationship with the CollabNet
employees, and most likely would not have objected if we'd just given
Mike commit access the day he was hired.  But we knew we'd be setting
a precedent.  If we granted Mike commit access by fiat, we'd be saying
that CollabNet had the right to ignore project guidelines, simply
because it was the primary funder.  While the damage from this would
not necessarily be immediately apparent, it would gradually result in
the non-salaried developers feeling disenfranchised.  Other people
have to earn their commit access&#8212;CollabNet just buys
it.</p><p>So Mike agreed to start out his employment at CollabNet like any
other volunteer developer, without commit access.  He sent patches to
the public mailing list, where they could be, and were, reviewed by
everyone.  We also said on the list that we were doing things this way
deliberately, so there could be no missing the point.  After a couple
of weeks of solid activity by Mike, someone (I can't remember if it
was a CollabNet developer or not) proposed him for commit access, and
he was accepted, as we knew he would be.</p><p>That kind of consistency gets you a credibility that money could
never buy.  And credibility is a valuable currency to have in
technical discussions: it's immunization against having one's motives
questioned later.  In the heat of argument, people will sometimes look
for non-technical ways to win the battle.  The project's primary
funder, because of its deep involvement and obvious concern over the
directions the project takes, presents a wider target than most.  By
being scrupulous to observe all project guidelines right from the
start, the funder makes itself the same size as everyone else.</p><p>(See also Danese Cooper's blog at
<a class="ulink" href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/DaneseCooper/20040916" target="_top">http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/DaneseCooper/20040916</a>
for a similar story about commit access.  Cooper was then Sun
Microsystem's "Open Source Diva"&#8212;I believe that was her official
title&#8212;and in the blog entry, she describes how the Tomcat
development community got Sun to hold its own developers to the same
commit-access standards as the non-Sun developers.)</p><p>The need for the funders to play by the same rules as everyone
else means that the Benevolent Dictatorship governance model (see
<a class="xref" href="#benevolent-dictator" title="Benevolent Dictators">&#8222;Benevolent Dictators&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Rozdzia&#322; 4, <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>) is slightly
harder to pull
off in the presence of funding, particularly if the dictator works for
the primary funder.  Since a dictatorship has few rules, it is hard
for the funder to prove that it's abiding by community standards, even
when it is.  It's certainly not impossible; it just requires a project
leader who is able to see things from the point of view of the outside
developers, as well as that of the funder, and act accordingly.  Even
then, it's probably a good idea to have a proposal for non-dictatorial
governance sitting in your back pocket, ready to be brought out the
moment there are any indications of widespread dissatisfaction in the
community.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Contracting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="contracting"></a>Contracting</h2></div></div></div><p>Contracted work needs to be handled carefully in free software
projects.  Ideally, you want a contractor's work to be accepted by the
community and folded into the public distribution.  In theory, it
wouldn't matter who the contractor is, as long as his work is good and
meets the project's guidelines.  Theory and practice can sometimes
match, too: a complete stranger who shows up with a good patch
<span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> generally be able to get it into the
software.  The trouble is, it's very hard to produce a good patch for
a non-trivial enhancement or new feature while truly being a complete
stranger; one must first discuss it with the rest of the project.  The
duration of that discussion cannot be precisely predicted.  If the
contractor is paid by the hour, you may end up paying more than you
expected; if he is paid a flat sum, he may end up doing more work
than he can afford.</p><p>There are two ways around this.  The preferred way is to make an
educated guess about the length of the discussion process, based on
past experience, add in some padding for error, and base the contract
on that.  It also helps to divide the problem into as many small,
independent chunks as possible, to increase the predictability of each
chunk.  The other way is to contract solely for delivery of a patch,
and treat the patch's acceptance into the public project as a separate
matter.  Then it becomes much easier to write the contract, but you're
stuck with the burden of maintaining a private patch for as long as
you depend on the software, or at least for as long as it takes you to
get that patch or equivalent functionality into the mainline.  Of
course, even with the preferred way, the contract itself cannot
require that the patch be accepted into the code, because that would
involve selling something that's not for sale.  (What if the rest of
the project unexpectedly decides not to support the feature?)
However, the contract can require a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">bona
fide</em></span> effort to get the change accepted by the
community, and that it be committed to the repository if the community
agrees with it.  For example, if the project has written standards
regarding code changes, the contract can reference those standards and
specify that the work must meet them.  In practice, this usually works
out the way everyone hopes.</p><p>The best tactic for successful contracting is to hire one of the
project's developers&#8212;preferably a committer&#8212;as the
contractor.  This may seem like a form of purchasing influence, and,
well, it is.  But it's not as corrupt as it might seem.  A developer's
influence in the project is due mainly to the quality of his code and
to his interactions with other developers.  The fact that he has a
contract to get certain things done doesn't raise his status in any
way, and doesn't lower it either, though it may make people scrutinize
him more carefully.  Most developers would not risk their long-term
position in the project by backing an inappropriate or widely disliked
new feature.  In fact, part of what you get, or should get, when you
hire such a contractor is advice about what sorts of changes are
likely to be accepted by the community.  You also get a slight shift
in the project's priorities.  Because prioritization is just a matter
of who has time to work on what, when you pay for someone's time, you
cause their work to move up in the priority queue a bit.  This is a
well-understood fact of life among experienced open source developers,
and at least some of them will devote attention to the contractor's
work simply because it looks like it's going to <span class="emphasis"><em>get
done</em></span>, so they want to help it get done right.  Perhaps they
won't write any of the code, but they'll still discuss the design and
review the code, both of which can be very useful.  For all these
reasons, the contractor is best drawn from the ranks of those already
involved with the project.</p><p>This immediately raises two questions: Should contracts ever be
private?  And when they're not, should you worry about creating
tensions in the community by the fact that you've contracted with some
developers and not others?</p><p>It's best to be open about contracts, when you can.  Otherwise,
the contractor's behavior may seem strange to others in the
community&#8212;perhaps he's suddenly giving inexplicably high
priority to features he's never shown interest in in the past.  When
people ask him why he wants them now, how can he answer convincingly
if he can't talk about the fact that he's been contracted to write
them?</p><p>At the same time, neither you nor the contractor should act as
though others should treat your arrangement as a big deal.  Too often
I've seen contractors waltz onto a development list with the attitude
that their posts should be taken more seriously simply because they're
being paid.  That kind of attitude signals to the rest of the project
that the contractor regards the fact of the contract&#8212;as opposed
to the code <span class="emphasis"><em>resulting</em></span> from the contract&#8212;to
be the important thing.  But from the other developers' point of view,
only the code matters.  At all times, the focus of attention should be
kept on technical issues, not on the details of who is paying whom.
For example, one of the developers in the Subversion community handles
contracting in a particularly graceful way.  While discussing his code
changes in IRC, he'll mention as an aside (often in a private remark,
an IRC <em class="firstterm">privmsg</em>, to one of the other committers)
that he's being paid for his work on this particular bug or feature.
But he also consistently gives the impression that he'd want to be
working on that change anyway, and that he's happy the money is making
it possible for him to do that.  He may or may not reveal his
customer's identity, but in any case he doesn't dwell on the contract.
His remarks about it are just an ornament to an otherwise technical
discussion about how to get something done.</p><p>That example shows another reason why it's good to be open about
contracts.  There may be multiple organizations sponsoring contracts
on a given open source project, and if each knows what the others are
trying to do, they may be able to pool their resources.  In the above
case, the project's largest funder (CollabNet) is not involved in any
way with these piecework contracts, but knowing that someone else is
sponsoring certain bug fixes allows CollabNet to redirect its
resources to other bugs, resulting in greater efficiency for the
project as a whole.</p><p>Will other developers resent that some are paid for working on
the project?  In general, no, particularly when those who are paid are
established, well-respected members of the community anyway.  No one
expects contract work to be distributed equally among all the
committers.  People understand the importance of long-term
relationships: the uncertainties involved in contracting are such that
once you find someone you can work reliably with, you would be
reluctant to switch to a different person just for the sake of
evenhandedness.  Think of it this way: the first time you hire, there
will be no complaints, because clearly you had to pick
<span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span>&#8212;it's not your fault you can't hire
everyone.  Later, when you hire the same person a second time, that's
just common sense: you already know him, the last time was
successful, so why take unnecessary risks?  Thus, it's perfectly
natural to have one or two go-to people in the community, instead of
spreading the work around evenly.</p><div class="sect2" title="Review and Acceptance of Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="community-review-acceptance"></a>Review and Acceptance of Changes</h3></div></div></div><p>The community is still important to the success of contract
work.  Their involvement in the design and review process for sizeable
changes cannot be an afterthought.  It must be considered part of the
work, and fully embraced by the contractor.  Don't think of community
scrutiny as an obstacle to be overcome&#8212;think of it as a free
design board and QA department.  It is a benefit to be aggressively
pursued, not merely endured.</p><div class="sect3" title="Case study: the CVS password-authentication protocol"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="cvs-pserver"></a>Case study: the CVS password-authentication protocol</h4></div></div></div><p>In 1995, I was one half of a partnership that provided support
and enhancements for CVS (the Concurrent Versions System; see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cvshome.org/" target="_top">http://www.cvshome.org/</a>).  My partner Jim and I were,
informally, the maintainers of CVS by that point.  But we'd never
thought carefully about how we ought to relate to the existing, mostly
volunteer CVS development community.  We just assumed that they'd send
in patches, and we'd apply them, and that was pretty much how it
worked.</p><p>Back then, networked CVS could be done only over a remote login
program such as <code class="literal">rsh</code>.  Using the same password for
CVS access as for login access was an obvious security risk, and many
organizations were put off by it.  A major investment bank hired us to
add a new authentication mechanism, so they could safely use networked
CVS with their remote offices.</p><p>Jim and I took the contract and sat down to design the new
authentication system.  What we came up with was pretty simple (the
United States had export controls on cryptographic code at the time,
so the customer understood that we couldn't implement strong
authentication), but as we were not experienced in designing such
protocols, we still made a few gaffes that would have been obvious to
an expert.  These mistakes would easily have been caught had we taken
the time to write up a proposal and run it by the other developers for
review.  But we never did so, because it didn't occur to us to think
of the development list as a resource to be used.  We knew that people
were probably going to accept whatever we committed, and&#8212;because
we didn't know what we didn't know&#8212;we didn't bother to do the
work in a visible way, e.g., posting patches frequently, making small,
easily digestible commits to a special branch, etc.  The resulting
authentication protocol was not very good, and of course, once it
became established, it was difficult to improve, because of
compatibility concerns.</p><p>The root of the problem was not lack of experience; we could
easily have learned what we needed to know.  The problem was our
attitude toward the volunteer development community.  We regarded
acceptance of the changes as a hurdle to leap, rather than as a
process by which the quality of the changes could be improved.  Since
we were confident that almost anything we did would be accepted (as it
was), we made little effort to get others involved.</p></div><p>Obviously, when you're choosing a contractor, you want someone
with the right technical skills and experience for the job.  But it's
also important to choose someone with a track record of constructive
interaction with the other developers in the community.  That way
you're getting more than just a single person; you're getting an agent
who will be able to draw on a network of expertise to make sure the
work is done in a robust and maintainable way.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Funding Non-Programming Activities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="funding-non-programming"></a>Funding Non-Programming Activities</h2></div></div></div><p>Programming is only part of the work that goes on in an open
source project.  From the point of view of the project's volunteers,
it's the most visible and glamorous part.  This unfortunately means
that other activities, such as documentation, formal testing, etc., can
sometimes be neglected, at least compared to the amount of attention
they often receive in proprietary software.  Corporate organizations
are sometimes able to make up for this, by devoting some of their
internal software development infrastructure to open source
projects.</p><p>The key to doing this successfully is to translate between the
company's internal processes and those of the public development
community.  Such translation is not effortless: often the two are not
a close match, and the differences can only be bridged via human
intervention.  For example, the company may use a different bug
tracker than the public project.  Even if they use the same tracking
software, the data stored in it will be very different, because the
bug-tracking needs of a company are very different from those of a
free software community.  A piece of information that starts in one
tracker may need to be reflected in the other, with confidential
portions removed or, in the other direction, added.</p><p>The sections that follow are about how to build and maintain
such bridges.  The end result should be that the open source project
runs more smoothly, the community recognizes the company's investment
of resources, and yet does not feel that the company is
inappropriately steering things toward its own goals.</p><div class="sect2" title="Quality Assurance (i.e., Professional Testing)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="subsidize-qa"></a>Quality Assurance (i.e., Professional Testing)</h3></div></div></div><p>In proprietary software development, it is normal to have teams
of people dedicated solely to quality assurance: bug hunting,
performance and scalability testing, interface and documentation
checking, etc.  As a rule, these activities are not pursued as
vigorously by the volunteer community on a free software project.
This is partly because it's hard to get volunteer labor for
unglamorous work like testing, partly because people tend to assume
that having a large user community gives the project good testing
coverage, and, in the case of performance and scalability testing,
partly because volunteers often don't have access to the necessary
hardware resources anyway.</p><p>The assumption that having many users is equivalent to having
many testers is not entirely baseless.  Certainly there's little point
assigning testers for basic functionality in common environments: bugs
there will quickly be found by users in the natural course of things.
But because users are just trying to get work done, they do not
consciously set out to explore uncharted edge cases in the program's
functionality, and are likely to leave certain classes of bugs
unfound.  Furthermore, when they discover a bug with an easy
workaround, they often silently implement the workaround without
bothering to report the bug.  Most insidiously, the usage patterns of
your customers (the people who drive <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
interest in the software) may differ in statistically significant ways
from the usage patterns of the Average User In The Street.</p><p>A professional testing team can uncover these sorts of bugs, and
can do so as easily with free software as with proprietary software.
The challenge is to convey the testing team's results back to the
public in a useful form.  In-house testing departments usually have
their own way of reporting test results, involving company-specific
jargon, or specialized knowledge about particular customers and their
data sets.  Such reports would be inappropriate for the public bug
tracker, both because of their form and because of confidentiality
concerns.  Even if your company's internal bug tracking software
were the same as that used by the public project, management might
need to make company-specific comments and metadata changes to the
issues (for example, to raise an issue's internal priority, or
schedule its resolution for a particular customer).  Usually such
notes are confidential&#8212;sometimes they're not even shown to the
customer.  But even when they're not confidential, they're of no
concern to the public project, and therefore the public should not be
distracted with them.</p><p>Yet the core bug report itself <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important
to the public.  In fact, a bug report from your testing department is
in some ways more valuable than one received from users at large,
since the testing department probes for things that other users won't.
Given that you're unlikely to get that particular bug report from any
other source, you definitely want to preserve it and make it
available to the public project.</p><p>To do this, either the QA department can file issues directly in
the public issue tracker, if they're comfortable with that, or an
intermediary (usually one of the developers) can "translate" the
testing department's internal reports into new issues in the public
tracker.  Translation simply means describing the bug in a way that
makes no reference to customer-specific information (the reproduction
recipe may use customer data, assuming the customer approves it, of
course).</p><p>It is somewhat preferable to have the QA department filing
issues in the public tracker directly.  That gives the public a more
direct appreciation of your company's involvement with the project:
useful bug reports add to your organization's credibility just as any
technical contribution would.  It also gives developers a direct line
of communication to the testing team.  For example, if the internal QA
team is monitoring the public issue tracker, a developer can commit a
fix for a scalability bug (which the developer may not have the
resources to test herself), and then add a note to the issue asking
the QA team to see if the fix had the desired effect.  Expect a bit of
resistance from some of the developers; programmers have a tendency to
regard QA as, at best, a necessary evil.  The QA team can easily
overcome this by finding significant bugs and filing comprehensible
reports; on the other hand, if their reports are not at least as good
as those coming from the regular user community, then there's no point
having them interact directly with the development team.</p><p>Either way, once a public issue exists, the original internal
issue should simply reference the public issue for technical content.
Management and paid developers may continue to annotate the internal
issue with company-specific comments as necessary, but use the public
issue for information that should be available to everyone.</p><p>You should go into this process expecting extra overhead.
Maintaining two issues for one bug is, naturally, more work than
maintaining one issue.  The benefit is that many more coders will see
the report and be able to contribute to a solution.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Legal Advice and Protection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="subsidize-legal"></a>Legal Advice and Protection</h3></div></div></div><p>Corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, are almost the only
entities that ever pay attention to complex legal issues in free
software.  Individual developers often understand the nuances of
various open source licenses, but they generally do not have the time
or resources to follow copyright, trademark, and patent law in detail.
If your company has a legal department, it can help a project by
vetting the copyright status of the code, and helping developers
understand possible patent and trademark issues.  The exact forms this
help could take are discussed in <a class="xref" href="#legal" title="Rozdzia&#322; 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Rozdzia&#322; 9, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a>.  The
main thing is to make sure that communications between the legal
department and the development community, if they happen at all,
happen with a mutual appreciation of the very different universes the
parties are coming from.  On occasion, these two groups talk past each
other, each side assuming domain-specific knowledge that the other
does not have.  A good strategy is to have a liaison (usually a
developer, or else a lawyer with technical expertise) stand in the
middle and translate for as long as needed.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Documentation and Usability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="subsidize-documentation-usability"></a>Documentation and Usability</h3></div></div></div><p>Documentation and usability are both famous weak spots in open
source projects, although I think, at least in the case of
documentation, that the difference between free and proprietary
software is frequently exaggerated.  Nevertheless, it is empirically
true that much open source software lacks first-class documentation
and usability research.</p><p>If your organization wants to help fill these gaps for a
project, probably the best thing it can do is hire people who
are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> regular developers on the project, but
who will be able to interact productively with the developers.
Not hiring regular developers is good for two reasons: one, that way
you don't take development time away from the project; two, those
closest to the software are usually the wrong people to write
documentation or investigate usability anyway, because they have
trouble seeing the software from an outsider's point of view.</p><p>However, it will still be necessary for whoever works on these
problems to communicate with the developers.  Find people who are
technical enough to talk to the coding team, but not so expert in the
software that they can't empathize with regular users anymore.</p><p>A medium-level user is probably the right person to write good
documentation.  In fact, after the first edition of this book was
published, I received the following email from an open source
developer named Dirk Reiners:</p><pre class="screen">
One comment on Money::Documentation and Usability: when we had some 
money to spend and decided that a beginner's tutorial was the most 
critical piece that we needed we hired a medium-level user to write it. 
He had gone through the induction to the system recently enough to 
remember the problems, but he had gotten past them so he knew how to 
describe them. That allowed him to write something that needed only 
minor fixes by the core developers for the things that he hadn't gotten 
right, but still covering the 'obvious' stuff devs would have missed.

His case was even better, as it had been his job to introduce a bunch of 
other people (students) to the system, so he combined the experience of 
many people, which is something that was just a lucky occurrence and is 
probably hard to get in most cases.

<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>), providing a
server and network connection&#8212;and most importantly, system
administration help&#8212;can be of significant assistance.  Even if
this is all your organization does for the project, it can be a
moderately effective way to obtain good public relations karma, though
it will not bring any influence over the direction of the
project.</p><p>You can probably expect a banner ad or an acknowledgment on the
project's home page, thanking your company for providing hosting.  If
you set up the hosting so that the project's web address is under your
company's domain name, then you will get some additional association
just through the URL.  This will cause most users to think of the
software as having <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> to do with your
company, even if you don't contribute to development at all.  The
problem is, the developers are aware of this associative tendency too,
and may not be very comfortable with having the project in your domain
unless you're contributing more resources than just bandwidth.  After
all, there are a lot of places to host these days.  The community may
eventually feel that the implied misallocation of credit is not worth
the convenience brought by hosting, and take the project elsewhere.
So if you want to provide hosting, do so&#8212;but either plan to get
even more involved soon, or be circumspect about how much involvement
you claim.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Marketing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="marketing"></a>Marketing</h2></div></div></div><p>Although most open source developers would probably hate to

<span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> create buzz around an open source product,
even to the point where hardheaded coders find themselves having
vaguely positive thoughts about the software for reasons they can't
quite put their finger on.  It is not my place here to dissect the
arms-race dynamics of marketing in general.  Any corporation involved
in free software will eventually find itself considering how to market
themselves, the software, or their relationship to the

your side, it is <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> important not to say
anything that isn't demonstrably true.  Audit all claims carefully
before making them, and give the public the means to check your claims
on their own.  Independent fact checking is a major part of open
source, and it applies to more than just the code.</p><p>Naturally no one would advise companies to make unverifiable
claims anyway.  But with open source activities, there is an unusually
high quantity of people with the expertise to verify
claims&#8212;people who are also likely to have high-bandwidth
Internet access and the right social contacts to publicize their
findings in a damaging way, should they choose to.  When Global
Megacorp Chemical Industries pollutes a stream, that's verifiable, but
only by trained scientists, who can then be refuted by Global
Megacorp's scientists, leaving the public scratching their heads and
wondering what to think.  On the other hand, your behavior in the open
source world is not only visible and recorded; it is also easy for many
people to check it independently, come to their own conclusions, and
spread those conclusions by word of mouth.  These communications
networks are already in place; they are the essence of how open source
operates, and they can be used to transmit any sort of information.
Refutation is usually difficult, if not impossible, especially when
what people are saying is true.</p><p>For example, it's okay to refer to your organization as having
"founded project X" if you really did.  But don't refer to yourself as
the "makers of X" if most of the code was written by outsiders.
Conversely, don't claim to have a deeply involved volunteer developer
community if anyone can look at your repository and see that there are
few or no code changes coming from outside your organization.</p><p>Not too long ago, I saw an announcement by a very well-known
computer company, stating that they were releasing an important
software package under an open source license.  When the initial
announcement came out, I took a look at their now-public version
control repository and saw that it contained only three revisions.  In
other words, they had done an initial import of the source code, but
hardly anything had happened since then.  That in itself was not
worrying&#8212;they'd just made the announcement, after all.  There
was no reason to expect a lot of development activity right
away.</p><p>Some time later, they made another announcement.  Here is what
it said, with the name and release number replaced by pseudonyms:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>We are pleased to announce that following
    rigorous testing by the Singer Community, Singer 5 for Linux
    and Windows are now ready for production use.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Curious to know what the community had uncovered in "rigorous
testing," I went back to the repository to look at its recent change
history.  The project was still on revision 3.  Apparently, they
hadn't found a <span class="emphasis"><em>single</em></span> bug worth fixing before the
release!  Thinking that the results of the community testing must have
been recorded elsewhere, I next examined the bug tracker.  There were
exactly six open issues, four of which had been open for several months
already.</p><p>This beggars belief, of course.  When testers pound on a large
and complex piece of software for any length of time, they will find
bugs.  Even if the fixes for those bugs don't make it into the
upcoming release, one would still expect some version control activity
as a result of the testing process, or at least some new issues.  Yet
to all appearances, nothing had happened between the announcement of
the open source license and the first open source release.</p><p>The point is not that the company was lying about the community
testing.  I have no idea if they were or not.  But they were oblivious
to how much it <span class="emphasis"><em>looked</em></span> like they were lying.
Since neither the version control repository nor the issue tracker
gave any indication that the alleged rigorous testing had occurred,
the company should either not have made the claim in the first place,
or provided a clear link to some tangible result of that testing ("We
found 278 bugs; click here for details").  The latter would have
allowed anyone to get a handle on the level of community activity very
quickly.  As it was, it only took me a few minutes to determine that
whatever this community testing was, it had not left traces in any of
the usual places.  That's not a lot of effort, and I'm sure I'm not
the only one who took the trouble.</p><p>Transparency and verifiability are also an important part of
accurate crediting, of course.  See

source software.  It's perfectly okay to give negative
<span class="emphasis"><em>facts</em></span>&#8212;that is, easily confirmable
assertions of the sort often seen in good comparison charts.  But
negative characterizations of a less rigorous nature are best avoided,
for two reasons.  First, they are liable to start flame wars that
detract from productive discussion.  Second, and more importantly,
some of the volunteer developers in <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span> project
may turn out to work on the competing project as well.  This is more
likely than it at first might seem: the projects are already in the
same domain (that's why they're in competition), and developers with
expertise in that domain may make contributions wherever their
expertise is applicable.  Even when there is no direct developer
overlap, it is likely that developers on your project are at least
acquainted with developers on related projects.  Their ability to
maintain constructive personal ties could be hampered by
overly negative marketing messages.</p><p>Bashing competing closed-source products seems to be more widely
accepted in the open source world, especially when those products are
made by Microsoft.  Personally, I deplore this tendency (though again,
there's nothing wrong with straightforward factual comparisons), not
merely because it's rude, but also because it's dangerous for a
project to start believing its own hype and thereby ignore the ways in
which the competition may actually be superior.  In general, watch out
for the effect that marketing statements can have on your own
development community.  People may be so excited at being backed by
marketing dollars that they lose objectivity about their software's
true strengths and weaknesses.  It is normal, and even expected, for a
company's developers to exhibit a certain detachment toward marketing
statements, even in public forums.  Clearly, they should not come out
and contradict the marketing message directly (unless it's actually
wrong, though one hopes that sort of thing would have been caught
earlier).  But they may poke fun at it from time to time, as a way of
bringing the rest of the development community back down to
earth.</p></div></div></div><div class="chapter" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="communications"></a>Rozdzia&#322; 6.

one can have in an open source environment.  In the long run it
matters more than programming talent.  A great programmer with lousy
communications skills can get only one thing done at a time, and even
then may have trouble convincing others to pay attention.  But a lousy
programmer with good communications skills can coordinate and persuade
many people to do many different things, and thereby have a
significant effect on a project's direction and momentum.</p><p>There does not seem to be much correlation, in either direction,
between the ability to write good code and the ability to communicate
with one's fellow human beings.  There is some correlation between
programming well and describing technical issues well, but describing
technical issues is only a tiny part of the communications in a
project.  Much more important is the ability to empathize with one's
audience, to see one's own posts and comments as others see them, and
to cause others to see their own posts with similar objectivity.
Equally important is noticing when a given medium or communications
method is no longer working well, perhaps because it doesn't scale as
the number of users increases, and taking the time to do something
about it.</p><p>All of which is obvious in theory&#8212;what makes it hard in
practice is that free software development environments are
bewilderingly diverse both in audiences and in communications
mechanisms.  Should a given thought be expressed in a post to the
mailing list, as an annotation in the bug tracker, or as a comment
in the code?  When answering a question in a public forum, how much
knowledge can you assume on the part of the reader, given that "the
reader" is not only the one who asked the question in the first place,
but all those who might see your response?  How can the developers
stay in constructive contact with the users, without getting swamped
by feature requests, spurious bug reports, and general chatter?  How
do you tell when a medium has reached the limits of its capacity, and
what do you do about it?</p><p>Solutions to these problems are usually partial, because any
particular solution is eventually made obsolete by project growth or
changes in project structure.  They are also often <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hoc</em></span>, because they're improvised responses to dynamic
situations.  All participants need to be aware of when and how
communications can become bogged down, and be involved in
solutions.  Helping people do this is a big part of managing an open
source project.  The sections that follow discuss both how to conduct
your own communications, and how to make maintenance of communications
mechanisms a priority for everyone in the project.<sup>[<a name="idp7899904" href="#ftn.idp7899904" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect1" title="You Are What You Write"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="you-are-what-you-write"></a>You Are What You Write</h2></div></div></div><p>Consider this: the only thing anyone knows about you on the

Long-time free software hacker Jim Blandy tells the following
story:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Back in 1993, I was working for the Free Software Foundation,
  and we were beta-testing version 19 of GNU Emacs.  We'd make a beta
  release every week or so, and people would try it out and send us
  bug reports.  There was this one guy whom none of us had met in
  person but who did great work: his bug reports were always clear and
  led us straight to the problem, and when he provided a fix himself,
  it was almost always right.  He was top-notch.</p><p>Now, before the FSF can use code written by someone else, we
  have them do some legal paperwork to assign their copyright interest
  to that code to the FSF.  Just taking code from complete strangers
  and dropping it in is a recipe for legal disaster.</p><p>So I emailed the guy the forms, saying, "Here's some paperwork
  we need, here's what it means, you sign this one, have your employer
  sign that one, and then we can start putting in your fixes.  Thanks
  very much."</p><p>He sent me back a message saying, "I don't have an
  employer."</p><p>So I said, "Okay, that's fine, just have your university sign
  it and send it back."</p><p>After a bit, he wrote me back again, and said, "Well,
  actually...  I'm thirteen years old and I live with my
  parents."</p></blockquote></div><p>Because that kid didn't write like a thirteen-year-old, no one
knew that's what he was.  Following are some ways to make your writing
give a good impression too.</p><div class="sect2" title="Structure and Formatting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="structure-and-formatting"></a>Structure and Formatting</h3></div></div></div><p>Don't fall into the trap of writing everything as though it were
a cell phone text message.  Write in complete sentences, capitalizing
the first word of each sentence, and use paragraph breaks where
needed.  This is most important in emails and other composed writings.
In IRC or similarly ephemeral forums, it's generally okay to leave out
capitalization, use compressed forms of common expressions, etc.  Just
don't carry those habits over into more formal, persistent forums.
Emails, documentation, bug reports, and other pieces of writing that
are intended to have a permanent life should be written using standard
grammar and spelling, and have a coherent narrative structure.  This
is not because there's anything inherently good about following
arbitrary rules, but rather that these rules are
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> arbitrary: they evolved into their present
forms because they make text more readable, and you should adhere to
them for that reason.  Readability is desirable not only because it
means more people will understand what you write, but because it makes
you look like the sort of person who takes the time to communicate
clearly: that is, someone worth paying attention to.</p><p>For email in particular, experienced open source developers have
settled on certain conventions:</p><p>Send plain text mails only, not HTML, RichText, or other formats
that might be opaque to text-only mail readers.  Format your lines to
be around 72 columns long.  Don't exceed 80 columns, which has become
the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> standard terminal width
(that is, some people may use wider terminals, but no one uses a
narrower one).  By making your lines a little
<span class="emphasis"><em>less</em></span> than 80 columns, you leave room for a few
levels of quoting characters to be added in others' replies without
forcing a rewrapping of your text.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Use real line breaks.</em></span> Some mailers do a
kind of fake line wrapping, whereby when you're composing an email,
the display shows line breaks that aren't actually there.  When the
mail goes out, it may not have the line breaks you thought it had, and
it will wrap awkwardly on some people's screens.  If your mailer might
use fake line breaks, look for a setting you can tweak to make it show
the true line breaks as you compose.</p><p>When including screen output, snippets of code, or other
preformatted text, offset it clearly, so that even a lazy eye can
easily see the boundaries between your prose and the material you're
quoting.  (I never expected to write that advice when I started this
book, but on a number of open source mailing lists lately, I've seen
people mix texts from different sources without making it clear which
is which.  The effect is very frustrating.  It makes their posts
significantly harder to understand, and frankly makes those people
look a little bit disorganized.)</p><p>When quoting someone else's mail, insert your responses where
they're most appropriate, at several different places if necessary,
and trim off the parts of their mail you didn't use.  If you're
writing a quick comment that applies to their entire post, it's okay
to <em class="firstterm">top-post</em> (that is, to put your response
above the quoted text of their mail); otherwise, you should quote
the relevant portion of the original text first, followed by your
response.</p><p>Construct the subject lines of new mails carefully.  It's the
most important line in your mail, because it allows each other person
in the project to decide whether or not to read more.  Modern
mail reading software organizes groups of related messages into
threads, which can be defined not only by a common subject, but by
various other headers (which are sometimes not displayed).  It follows
that if a thread starts to drift to a new topic, you can&#8212;and
should&#8212;adjust the subject line accordingly when replying.  The
thread's integrity will be preserved, due to those other headers, but
the new subject will help people looking at an overview of the thread
know that the topic has drifted.  Likewise, if you really want to
start a new topic, do it by posting a fresh mail, not by replying to
an existing mail and changing the subject.  Otherwise, your mail would
still be grouped in to the same thread as what you're replying to, and
thus fool people into thinking it's about something it's not.  Again,
the penalty would not only be the waste of their time, but the slight
dent in your credibility as someone fluent in using communications
tools.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Content"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="writing-content"></a>Content</h3></div></div></div><p>Well-formatted mails attract readers, but content keeps them.
No set of fixed rules can guarantee good content, of course, but there
are some principles that make it more likely.</p><p>Make things easy for your readers.  There's a ton of information
floating around in any active open source project, and readers cannot
be expected to be familiar with most of it&#8212;indeed, they cannot
always be expected to know how to become familiar.  Wherever possible,
your posts should provide information in the form most convenient for
readers.  If you have to spend an extra two minutes to dig up the URL
to a particular thread in the mailing list archives, in order to save
your readers the trouble of doing so, it's worth it.  If you have to
spend an extra 5 or 10 minutes summarizing the conclusions so far
of a complex thread, in order to give people context in which to
understand your post, then do so.  Think of it this way: the more
successful a project, the higher the reader-to-writer ratio in any
given forum.  If every post you make is seen by <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span>
people, then as <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> rises, the worthwhileness of
expending extra effort to save those people time rises with it.  And
as people see you imposing this standard on yourself, they will work
to match it in their own communications.  The result is, ideally, an
increase in the global efficiency of the project: when there is a
choice between <span class="emphasis"><em>n</em></span> people making an effort and one
person doing so, the project prefers the latter.</p><p>Don't engage in hyperbole.  Exaggerating in online posts is a
classic arms race.  For example, a person reporting a bug may worry
that the developers will not pay sufficient attention, so he'll
describe it as a severe, showstopper problem that is preventing him
(and all his friends/coworkers/cousins) from using the software
productively, when it's actually only a mild annoyance.  But
exaggeration is not limited to users&#8212;programmers often do the
same thing during technical debates, particularly when the
disagreement is over a matter of taste rather than correctness:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"Doing it that way would make the code totally
     unreadable.  It'd be a maintenance nightmare, compared to
     J. Random's proposal..."</p></blockquote></div><p>The same sentiment actually becomes
<span class="emphasis"><em>stronger</em></span> when phrased less sharply:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"That works, but it's less than ideal in terms of
     readability and maintainability, I think.  J. Random's proposal
     avoids those problems because it..."</p></blockquote></div><p>You will not be able to get rid of hyperbole completely, and in
general it's not necessary to do so.  Compared to other forms of
miscommunication, hyperbole is not globally damaging&#8212;it hurts
mainly the perpetrator.  The recipients can compensate, it's just that
the sender loses a little more credibility each time.  Therefore, for
the sake of your own influence in the project, try to err on the side
of moderation.  That way, when you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> need to
make a strong point, people will take you seriously.</p><p>Edit twice.  For any message longer than a medium-sized
paragraph, reread it from top to bottom before sending it but after
you think it's done the first time.  This is familiar advice to anyone
who's taken a composition class, but it's especially important in
online discussion.  Because the process of online composition tends to
be highly discontinuous (in the course of writing a message, you may
need to go back and check other mails, visit certain web pages, run a
command to capture its debugging output, etc.), it's especially easy to
lose your sense of narrative place.  Messages that were composed
discontinuously and not checked before being sent are often
recognizable as such, much to the chagrin (or so one would hope) of
their authors.  Take the time to review what you send.  The more your
posts hold together structurally, the more they will be read.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Tone"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="writing-tone"></a>Tone</h3></div></div></div><p>After writing thousands of messages, you will probably find your
style tending toward the terse.  This seems to be the norm in most
technical forums, and there's nothing wrong with it per se.  A degree
of terseness that would be unacceptable in normal social interactions
is simply the default for free software hackers.  Here's a response I
once drew on a mailing list about some free content management
software, quoted in full:</p><pre class="screen">
Can you possibly elaborate a bit more on exactly what problems
you ran into, etc?

Also:

What version of Slash are you using? I couldn't tell from your
original message.

Exactly how did you build the apache/mod_perl source?

Did you try the Apache 2.0 patch that was posted about on
slashcode.com?

  Shane
</pre><p>Now <span class="emphasis"><em>that's</em></span> terse!  No greeting, no sign-off
other than his name, and the message itself is just a series of
questions phrased as compactly as possible.  His one declarative
sentence was an implicit criticism of my original message.  And yet, I
was happy to see Shane's mail, and didn't take his terseness as a sign
of anything other than him being a busy person.  The mere fact that he
was asking questions, instead of ignoring my post, meant that he was
willing to spend some time on my problem.</p><p>Will all readers react positively to this style?  Not
necessarily; it depends on the person and the context.  For example,
if someone has just posted acknowledging that she made a mistake
(perhaps she wrote a bug), and you know from past experience that
this person tends to be a bit insecure, then while you may still write
a compact response, you should make sure to leaven it with some sort
of acknowledgment of her feelings.  The bulk of your response might
be a brief, engineer's-eye analysis of the situation, as terse as you
want.  But at the end, sign off with something indicating that your
terseness is not to be taken as coldness.  For example, if you've just
given reams of advice about exactly how the person should fix the bug,
then sign off with "Good luck, &lt;your name here&gt;" to indicate
that you wish them well and are not mad.  A strategically placed
smiley face or other emoticlue can often be enough to reassure an
interlocutor, too.</p><p>It may seem odd to focus as much on the participant's feelings
as on the surface of what they say, but to put it baldly, feelings
affect productivity.  Feelings are important for other reasons too,
but even confining ourselves to purely utilitarian grounds, we may
note that unhappy people write worse software, and less of it.  Given
the restricted nature of most electronic media, though, there will
often be no overt clue as to how a person is feeling.  You will have
to make an educated guess based on a) how most people would feel in
that situation, and b) what you know of this particular person from
past interactions.  Some people prefer a more hands-off attitude, and
simply deal with everyone at face value, the idea being that if a
participant doesn't say outright that she feels a particular way, then
one has no business treating her as though she does.  I don't buy this
approach, for a couple of reasons.  One, people don't behave that way
in real life, so why would they online?  Two, since most interactions
take place in public forums, people tend to be even more restrained in
expressing emotions than they might be in private.  To be more
precise, they are often willing to express emotions directed at
others, such as gratitude or outrage, but not emotions directed
inwardly, such as insecurity or pride.  Yet most humans work better
when they know that others are aware of their state of mind.  By
paying attention to small clues, you can usually guess right most of
the time, and motivate people to stay involved to a greater degree
than they otherwise might.</p><p>I don't mean, of course, that your role is to be a group
therapist, constantly helping everyone to get in touch with their
feelings.  But by paying careful attention to long-term patterns in
people's behavior, you will begin to get a sense of them as
individuals even if you never meet them face-to-face.  And by being
sensitive to the tone of your own writing, you can have a surprising
amount of influence over how others feel, to the ultimate benefit of
the project.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Recognizing Rudeness"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="rudeness"></a>Recognizing Rudeness</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the defining characteristics of open source culture is
its distinctive notions of what does and does not constitute rudeness.
While the conventions described below are not unique to free software
development, nor even to software in general&#8212;they would be
familiar to anyone working in mathematics, the hard sciences, or
engineering disciplines&#8212;free software, with its porous
boundaries and constant influx of newcomers, is an environment where
these conventions are especially likely to be encountered by people
unfamiliar with them.</p><p>Let's start with the things that are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
rude:</p><p>Technical criticism, even when direct and unpadded, is not rude.
Indeed, it can be a form of flattery: the critic is saying, by
implication, that the target is worth taking seriously, and is worth
spending some time on.  That is, the more viable it would have been to
simply ignore someone's post, the more of a compliment it becomes to
take the time to criticize it (unless the critique descends into an
<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad hominem</em></span> attack or some other form of
obvious rudeness, of course).</p><p>Blunt, unadorned questions, such as Shane's questions to me in
the previously quoted email, are not rude either.  Questions that in
other contexts might seem cold, rhetorical, or even mocking, are often
intended seriously, and have no hidden agenda other than eliciting
information as quickly as possible.  The famous technical support
question "Is your computer plugged in?" is a classic example of this.
The support person really does need to know if your computer is
plugged in, and after the first few days on the job, has gotten tired
of prefixing her question with polite blandishments ("I beg your
pardon, I just want to ask a few simple questions to rule out some
possibilities.  Some of these might seem pretty basic, but bear with
me...").  At this point, she doesn't bother with the padding anymore,
she just asks straight out: is it plugged in or not?  Equivalent
questions are asked all the time on free software mailing lists.  The
intent is not to insult the recipient, but to quickly rule out the
most obvious (and perhaps most common) explanations.  Recipients who
understand this and react accordingly win points for taking a
broad-minded view without prompting.  But recipients who react badly
should not be reprimanded, either.  It's just a collision of cultures,
not anyone's fault.  Explain amiably that your question (or criticism)
had no hidden meanings; it was just meant to get (or transmit)
information as efficiently as possible, nothing more.</p><p>So what is rude?</p><p>By the same principle under which detailed technical criticism
is a form of flattery, failure to provide quality criticism can be a
kind of insult.  I don't mean simply ignoring someone's work, be it
proposal, code change, new issue filing, or whatever.  Unless you
explicitly promised a detailed reaction in advance, it's usually okay
to simply not react at all.  People will assume you just didn't have
time to say anything.  But if you <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span> react, don't
skimp: take the time to really analyze things, provide concrete
examples where appropriate, dig around in the archives to find related
posts from the past, etc.  Or if you don't have time to put in that
kind of effort, but still need to write some sort of brief response,
then state the shortcoming openly in your message ("I think there's an
issue filed for this, but unfortunately didn't have time to search for
it, sorry").  The main thing is to recognize the existence of the
cultural norm, either by fulfilling it or by openly acknowledging
that one has fallen short this time.  Either way, the norm is
strengthened.  But failing to meet that norm, while at the same time
not explaining <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span> you failed to meet it, is like
saying the topic (and those participating in it) was not worth much
of your time.  Better to show that your time is valuable by being
terse than by being lazy.</p><p>There are many other forms of rudeness, of course, but most of

is a good enough guide to avoid them.  See also

recognizing faces.  It is known informally as the "fusiform face
area," and its capabilities are mostly inborn, not learned.  It turns
out that recognizing individual people is such a crucial survival
skill that we have evolved specialized hardware to do it.</p><p>Internet-based collaboration is therefore psychologically odd,
because it involves tight cooperation between human beings who almost
never get to identify each other by the most natural, intuitive
methods: facial recognition first of all, but also sound of voice,
posture, etc.  To compensate for this, try to use a consistent
<em class="firstterm">screen name</em> everywhere.  It should be the front
part of your email address (the part before the @-sign), your IRC
username, your repository committer name, your issue tracker username,
and so on.  This name is your online "face": a short identifying
string that serves some of the same purpose as your real face,
although it does not, unfortunately, stimulate the same built-in
hardware in the brain.</p><p>The screen name should be some intuitive permutation of your
real name (mine, for example, is "kfogel").  In some situations it
will be accompanied by your full name anyway, for example in mail
headers:</p><pre class="screen">
From: "Karl Fogel" &lt;kfogel@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre><p>Actually, there are two things going on in that example.  As
mentioned earlier, the screen name matches the real name in an
intuitive way.  But also, the real name is <span class="emphasis"><em>real</em></span>.
That is, it's not some made-up appellation like:</p><pre class="screen">
From: "Wonder Hacker" &lt;wonderhacker@whateverdomain.com&gt;
</pre><p>There's a famous cartoon by Paul Steiner, from the July 5, 1993
issue of <em class="citetitle">The New Yorker</em>, that shows one dog
logged into a computer terminal, looking down and telling another
conspiratorially: "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog."  This
kind of thought probably lies behind a lot of the self-aggrandizing,
meant-to-be-hip online identities people give themselves&#8212;as if
calling oneself "Wonder Hacker" will actually cause people to believe
one <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> a wonderful hacker.  But the fact remains:
even if no one knows you're a dog, you're still a dog.  A fantastical
online identity never impresses readers.  Instead, it makes them think
you're more into image than substance, or that you're simply insecure.
Use your real name for all interactions, or if for some reason you
require anonymity, then make up a name that sounds like a perfectly
normal real name, and use it consistently.</p><p>In addition to keeping your online face consistent, there are
some things you can do to make it more attractive.  If you have an
official title (e.g., "doctor", "professor", "director"), don't flaunt
it, nor even mention it except when it's directly relevant to the
conversation.  Hackerdom in general, and free software culture in
particular, tends to view title displays as exclusionary and a sign of
insecurity.  It's okay if your title appears as part of a standard
signature block at the end of every mail you send, just don't ever use
it as a tool to bolster your position in a discussion&#8212;the
attempt is guaranteed to backfire.  You want folks to respect the
person, not the title.</p><p>Speaking of signature blocks: keep them small and tasteful, or
better yet, nonexistent.  Avoid large legal disclaimers tacked on to
the end of every mail, especially when they express sentiments
incompatible with participation in a free software project.  For
example, the following classic of the genre appears at the end of
every post a particular user makes to a public mailing list I'm
on:</p><pre class="screen">

then, that huge disclaimer looks a bit silly but probably doesn't do
any lasting harm.  However, if this person wanted to participate
actively in the project, that legal boilerplate would start to have a
more insidious effect.  It would send at least two potentially
destructive signals: first, that this person doesn't have full control
over his tools&#8212;he's trapped inside some corporate mailer that
tacks an annoying message to the end of every email, and he hasn't got
any way to route around it&#8212;and second, that he has little or no
organizational support for his free software activities.  True, the
organization has clearly not banned him outright from posting to
public lists, but it has made his posts look distinctly unwelcoming,
as though the risk of letting out confidential information must trump
all other priorities.</p><p>If you work for an organization that insists on adding such

that you have to respond to everything.  You don't.  First of all,
there will usually be more threads going on than you can keep track
of, at least after the project is past its first few months.  Second,
even in the threads that you have decided to engage in, much of what
people say will not require a response.  Development forums in
particular tend to be dominated by three kinds of messages:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Messages proposing something non-trivial</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Messages expressing support or opposition to
                  something someone else has said</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Summing-up messages</p></li></ol></div><p>None of these <span class="emphasis"><em>inherently</em></span> requires a
response, particularly if you can be fairly sure, based on watching
the thread so far, that someone else is likely to say what you would
have said anyway.  (If you're worried that you'll be caught in a
wait-wait loop because all the others are using this tactic too, don't
be; there's almost always <span class="emphasis"><em>someone</em></span> out there
who'll feel like jumping into the fray.)  A response should be
motivated by a definite purpose.  Ask yourself first: do you know what
you want to accomplish?  And second: will it not get accomplished
unless you say something?</p><p>Two good reasons to add your voice to a thread are a) when you
see a flaw in a proposal and suspect that you're the only one who sees
it, and b) when you see that miscommunication is happening between
others, and know that you can fix it with a clarifying post.  It's
also generally fine to post just to thank someone for doing something,
or to say "Me too!", because a reader can tell right away that such
posts do not require any response or further action, and therefore the
mental effort demanded by the post ends cleanly when the reader
reaches the last line of the mail.  But even then, think twice before
saying something; it's always better to leave people wishing you'd
post more than wishing you'd post less.  (See the second half of <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed-full" title="Dodatek C. Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?">Dodatek C, <i>Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?</i></a> for more thoughts about how to behave on
a busy mailing list.)</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Productive vs Unproductive Threads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="productive-threads"></a>Productive vs Unproductive Threads</h3></div></div></div><p>On a busy mailing list, you have two imperatives.  One,
obviously, is to figure out what you need to pay attention to and what
you can ignore.  The other is to behave in a way that
avoids <span class="emphasis"><em>causing</em></span> noise: not only do you want your
own posts to have a high signal/noise ratio, you also want them to be
the sorts of messages that stimulate <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> people
to either post with a similarly high signal/noise ratio, or not post
at all.</p><p>To see how to do that, let's consider the context in which it is
done.  What are some of the hallmarks of an unproductive thread?</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Arguments that have been made already start being
            repeated, as though the poster thinks no one heard them
            the first time.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Increasing levels of hyperbole and involvement as
            the stakes get smaller and smaller.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A majority of comments coming from people who do
            little or nothing, while the people who tend to get things
            done are silent.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Many ideas discussed without clear proposals ever
            being made.  (Of course, any interesting idea starts out
            as an imprecise vision; the important question is what
            direction it goes from there.  Does the thread seem to be
            turning the vision into something more concrete, or is it
            spinning off into sub-visions, side-visions, and
            ontological disputes?)</p></li></ul></div><p>Just because a thread is not productive at first doesn't mean
it's a waste of time.  It might be about an important topic, in which
case the fact that it's not making any headway is all the more
troublesome.</p><p>Guiding a thread toward usefulness without being pushy is an
art.  It won't work to simply admonish people to stop wasting their
time, or to ask them not to post unless they have something constructive
to say.  You may, of course, think these things privately, but if you
say them out loud then you will be offensive.  Instead, you have to
suggest conditions for further progress&#8212;give people a route, a
path to follow that leads to the results you want, yet without
sounding like you're dictating conduct.  The distinction is largely
one of tone.  For example, this is bad:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This discussion is going nowhere.  Can we please
     drop this topic until someone has a patch to implement one of
     these proposals?  There's no reason to keep going around and
     around saying the same things.  Code speaks louder than
     words, folks.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Whereas this is good:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Several proposals have been floated in this
     thread, but none have had all the details fleshed out, at least
     not enough for an up-or-down vote.  Yet we're also not saying
     anything new now; we're just reiterating what has been said
     before.  So the best thing at this point would probably be for
     further posts to contain either a complete specification for the
     proposed behavior, or a patch.  Then at least we'd have a
     definite action to take (i.e., get consensus on the
     specification, or apply and test the patch).</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>Contrast the second approach with the first.  The second way
does not draw a line between you and the others, or accuse them of
taking the discussion into a spiral.  It talks about "we", which is
important whether or not you actually participated in the thread
before now, because it reminds everyone that even those who have been
silent thus far still have a stake in the thread's outcome.  It
describes why the thread is going nowhere, but does so without
pejoratives or judgements&#8212;it just dispassionately states
some facts.  Most importantly, it offers a positive course of action,
so that instead of people feeling like discussion is being closed off
(a restriction against which they can only be tempted to rebel), they
will feel as if they're being offered a way to take the conversation
to a more constructive level.  This is a standard people will
naturally want to meet.</p><p>You won't always want a thread to make it to the next level of
constructiveness&#8212;sometimes you'll want it to just go away.  The
purpose of your post, then, is to make it do one or the other.  If you
can tell from the way the thread has gone so far that no one is
actually <span class="emphasis"><em>going</em></span> to take the steps you suggested,
then your post effectively shuts down the thread without seeming to do
so.  Of course, there isn't any foolproof way to shut down a thread,
and even if there were, you wouldn't want to use it.  But asking
participants to either make visible progress or stop posting is
perfectly defensible, if done diplomatically.  Be wary of quashing
threads prematurely, however.  Some amount of speculative chatter can
be productive, depending on the topic, and asking for it to be
resolved too quickly will stifle the creative process, as well as make
you look impatient.</p><p>Don't expect any thread to stop on a dime.  There will probably
still be a few posts after yours, either because mails got crossed in
the pipe, or because people want to have the last word.  This is
nothing to worry about, and you don't need to post again.  Just let
the thread peter out, or not peter out, as the case may be.  You can't
have complete control; on the other hand, you can expect to have a
statistically significant effect across many threads.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="bikeshed"></a>The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate</h3></div></div></div><p>Although discussion can meander in any topic, the probability of
meandering goes up as the technical difficulty of the topic goes down.
After all, the greater the technical difficulty, the fewer
participants can really follow what's going on.  Those who can are
likely to be the most experienced developers, who have already taken
part in such discussions thousands of times before, and know what sort
of behavior is likely to lead to a consensus everyone can live
with.</p><p>Thus, consensus is hardest to achieve in technical questions
that are simple to understand and easy to have an opinion about, and
in "soft" topics such as organization, publicity, funding, etc.
People can participate in those arguments forever, because there are
no qualifications necessary for doing so, no clear ways to decide (even
afterward) if a decision was right or wrong, and because simply
outwaiting other discussants is sometimes a successful tactic.</p><p>The principle that the amount of discussion is inversely
proportional to the complexity of the topic has been around for a long
time, and is known informally as the <em class="firstterm">Bikeshed
Effect</em>.  Here is Poul-Henning Kamp's explanation of it,
from a now-famous post made to BSD developers:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It's a long story, or rather it's an old story, but it is quite
short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a book in the early
1960'ies, called "Parkinson's Law", which contains a lot of insight
into the dynamics of management.</p><p>[...]</p><p>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the other vital
component is an atomic power-plant, I guess that illustrates the age
of the book.</p><p>Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and
get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar
atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will be
tangled up in endless discussions.</p><p>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so
vast, so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, and
rather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody else
checked all the details before it got this far.  Richard P.  Feynmann
gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point, examples
relating to Los Alamos in his books.</p><p>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one of those
over a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV.  So no
matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with your
proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is doing his
job, that he is paying attention, that he
is <span class="emphasis"><em>here</em></span>.</p><p>In Denmark we call it "setting your fingerprint".  It is about
personal pride and prestige, it is about being able to point somewhere
and say "There!  <span class="emphasis"><em>I</em></span> did that."  It is a strong
trait in politicians, but present in most people given the chance.
Just think about footsteps in wet cement.</p></blockquote></div><p>(His complete post is very much worth reading, too.  See <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed-full" title="Dodatek C. Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?">Dodatek C, <i>Why Should I Care What Color the Bikeshed Is?</i></a>; see also
<a class="ulink" href="http://bikeshed.com" target="_top">http://bikeshed.com</a>.)</p><p>Anyone who's ever taken regular part in group decision-making
will recognize what Kamp is talking about.  However, it is usually
impossible to persuade <span class="emphasis"><em>everyone</em></span> to avoid painting
bikesheds.  The best you can do is point out that the phenomenon
exists, when you see it happening, and persuade the senior
developers&#8212;the people whose posts carry the most weight&#8212;to
drop their paintbrushes early, so at least they're not contributing to
the noise.  Bikeshed painting parties will never go away entirely, but
you can make them shorter and less frequent by spreading an awareness
of the phenomenon in the project's culture.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Avoid Holy Wars"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="holy-wars"></a>Avoid Holy Wars</h3></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">holy war</em> is a dispute, often but not
always over a relatively minor issue, which is not resolvable on the
merits of the arguments, but where people feel passionate enough to
continue arguing anyway in the hope that their side will prevail.
Holy wars are not quite the same as bikeshed paintings.  People
painting bikesheds are usually quick to jump in with an opinion
(because they can), but they won't necessarily feel strongly about it,
and indeed will sometimes express other, incompatible opinions, to
show that they understand all sides of the issue.  In a holy war, on
the other hand, understanding the other sides is a sign of weakness.
In a holy war, everyone knows there is One Right Answer; they just
don't agree on what it is.</p><p>Once a holy war has started, it generally cannot be resolved to
everyone's satisfaction.  It does no good to point out, in the midst
of a holy war, that a holy war is going on.  Everyone knows that
already.  Unfortunately, a common feature of holy wars is disagreement
on the very question of <span class="emphasis"><em>whether</em></span> the dispute is
resolvable by continued discussion.  Viewed from outside, it is clear
that neither side is changing the other's mind.  Viewed from inside,
the other side is being obtuse and not thinking clearly, but they
might come around if browbeaten enough.  Now, I am
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> saying there's never a right side in a holy
war.  Sometimes there is&#8212;in the holy wars I've participated
in, it's always been my side, of course.  But it doesn't matter,
because there's no algorithm for convincingly demonstrating that one
side or the other is right.</p><p>A common, but unsatisfactory, way people try to resolve holy
wars is to say "We've already spent far more time and energy
discussing this than it's worth!  Can we please just drop it?"  There
are two problems with this.  First, that time and energy has already
been spent and can never be recovered&#8212;the only question now is,
how much <span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> effort remains?  If some people
feel that just a little more discussion will bring the issue to a
close, then it still makes sense (from their point of view) to
continue.</p><p>The other problem with asking for the matter to be dropped is
that this is often equivalent to allowing one side, the status quo, to
declare victory by inaction.  And in some cases, the status quo is
known to be unacceptable anyway: everyone agrees that some decision
must be made, some action taken.  Dropping the subject would be worse
for everyone than simply giving up the argument would be for anyone.
But since that dilemma applies to all equally, it's still possible to
end up arguing forever about what to do.</p><p>So how should you handle holy wars?</p><p>The first answer is, try to set things up so they don't happen.
This is not as hopeless as it sounds:</p><p>You can anticipate certain standard holy wars: they tend to come
up over programming languages, licenses (see
<a class="xref" href="#license-compatibility" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">&#8222;The GPL and License Compatibility&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#legal" title="Rozdzia&#322; 9. Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">Rozdzia&#322; 9, <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a></span>), reply-to munging (see
<a class="xref" href="#reply-to" title="Wielka debata o nag&#322;ówek Reply-to">&#8222;Wielka debata o nag&#322;ówek Reply-to&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>), and a few
other topics.  Each project 
usually has a holy war or two all its own, as well, which longtime
developers will quickly become familiar with.  The techniques for
stopping holy wars, or at least limiting their damage, are pretty much
the same everywhere.  Even if you are positive your side is right, try
to find <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> way to express sympathy and
understanding for the points the other side is making.  Often the
problem in a holy war is that because each side has built its walls
as high as possible, and made it clear that any other opinion is sheer
foolishness, the act of surrendering or changing one's mind becomes
psychologically unbearable: it would be an admission not just of being
wrong, but of having been <span class="emphasis"><em>certain</em></span> and still being
wrong.  The way you can make this admission palatable for the other
side is to express some uncertainty yourself&#8212;precisely by
showing that you understand the arguments they are making and find
them at least sensible, if not finally persuasive.  Make a gesture
that provides space for a reciprocal gesture, and usually the
situation will improve.  You are no more or less likely to get the
technical result you wanted, but at least you can avoid unnecessary
collateral damage to the project's morale.</p><p>When a holy war can't be avoided, decide early how much you
care, and then be willing to publicly give up.  When you do so, you
can say that you're backing out because the holy war isn't worth it,
but don't express any bitterness and <span class="emphasis"><em>don't</em></span> take
the opportunity for a last parting shot at the opposing side's
arguments.  Giving up is effective only when done gracefully.</p><p>Programming language holy wars are a bit of a special case,
because they are often highly technical, yet many people feel
qualified to take part in them, and the stakes are very high, since
the result may determine what language a good portion of the project's
code is written in.  The best solution is to choose the language
early, with buy-in from influential initial developers, and then
defend it on the grounds that it's what you are all comfortable
writing in, <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> on the grounds that it's better
than some other language that could have been used instead.  Never let
the conversation degenerate into an academic comparison of programming
languages (this seems to happen especially often when someone brings
up Perl, for some reason); that's a death topic that you must simply
refuse to be drawn into.</p><p>For more historical background on holy wars, see <a class="ulink" href="http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/holy-wars.html" target="_top">http://catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/H/holy-wars.html</a>, and the
paper by Danny Cohen that popularized the term, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt" target="_top">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title='The "Noisy Minority" Effect'><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="noisy-minority"></a>The "Noisy Minority" Effect</h3></div></div></div><p>In any mailing list discussion, it's easy for a small minority
to give the impression that there is a great deal of dissent, by
flooding the list with numerous lengthy emails.  It's a bit like a
filibuster, except that the illusion of widespread dissent is even
more powerful, because it's divided across an arbitrary number of
discrete posts and most people won't bother to keep track of who said
what, when.  They'll just have an instinctive impression that the topic
is very controversial, and wait for the fuss to die down.</p><p>The best way to counteract this effect is to point it out very
clearly and provide supporting evidence showing how small the actual
number of dissenters is, compared to those in agreement.  In order to
increase the disparity, you may want to privately poll people who have
been mostly silent, but who you suspect would agree with the majority.
Don't say anything that suggests the dissenters were deliberately
trying to inflate the impression they were making.  Chances are they
weren't, and even if they were, there would be no strategic advantage
to pointing it out.  All you need do is show the actual numbers in a
side-by-side comparison, and people will realize that their intuition
of the situation does not match reality.</p><p>This advice doesn't just apply to issues with clear
for-and-against positions.  It applies to any discussion where a fuss
is being made, but it's not clear that most people consider the issue
under discussion to be a real problem.  After a while, if you agree that
the issue is not worthy of action, and can see that it has failed to
get much traction (even if it has generated a lot of mails), you can
just observe publicly that it's not getting traction.  If the "Noisy
Minority" effect has been at work, your post will seem like a breath of
fresh air.  Most people's impression of the discussion up to that
point will have been somewhat murky: "Huh, it sure feels like there's
some big deal here, because there sure are a lot of posts, but I can't
see any clear progress happening."  By explaining how the form of the
discussion made it appear more turbulent than it really was, you
retrospectively give it a new shape, through which people can recast
their understanding of what transpired.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Difficult People"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="difficult-people"></a>Difficult People</h2></div></div></div><p>Difficult people are no easier to deal with in electronic forums
than they are in person.  By "difficult" I don't mean "rude".  Rude
people are annoying, but they're not necessarily difficult.  This book
has already discussed how to handle them: comment on the rudeness the
first time, and from then on, either ignore them or treat them the same
as anyone else.  If they continue being rude, they will usually make
themselves so unpopular as to have no influence on others in the
project, so they are a self-containing problem.</p><p>The really difficult cases are people who are not overtly rude,
but who manipulate or abuse the project's processes in a way that ends
up costing other people time and energy, yet do not bring any benefit
to the project.  Such people often look for wedgepoints in the
project's procedures, to give themselves more influence than they
might otherwise have.  This is much more insidious than mere rudeness,
because neither the behavior nor the damage it causes is apparent to
casual observers.  A classic example is the filibuster, in which
someone (always sounding as reasonable as possible, of course) keeps
claiming that the matter under discussion is not ready for resolution,
and offers more and more possible solutions, or new viewpoints on old
solutions, when what is really going on is that he senses that a
consensus or a ballot is about to form, and doesn't like where it is
probably headed.  Another example is when there's a debate that won't
converge on consensus, but the group tries to at least clarify the
points of disagreement and produce a summary for everyone to refer to
from then on.  The obstructionist, who knows the summary may lead to a
result he doesn't like, will often try to delay even the summary, by
relentlessly complicating the question of what should be in it, either
by objecting to reasonable suggestions or by introducing unexpected
new items.</p><div class="sect2" title="Handling Difficult People"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="handling-difficult-people"></a>Handling Difficult People</h3></div></div></div><p>To counteract such behavior, it helps to understand the
mentality of those who engage in it.  People generally do not do it
consciously.  No one wakes up in the morning and says to himself:
"Today I'm going to cynically manipulate procedural forms in order to
be an irritating obstructionist."  Instead, such actions are often
preceded by a semi-paranoid feeling of being shut out of group
interactions and decisions.  The person feels he is not being taken
seriously, or (in the more severe cases) that there is almost a
conspiracy against him&#8212;that the other project members have decided to
form an exclusive club, of which he is not a member.  This then
justifies, in his mind, taking rules literally and engaging in a
formal manipulation of the project's procedures, in order
to <span class="emphasis"><em>make</em></span> everyone else take him seriously.  In
extreme cases, the person can even believe that he is fighting a
lonely battle to save the project from itself.</p><p>It is the nature of such an attack from within that not everyone
will notice it at the same time, and some people may not see it at all
unless presented with very strong evidence.  This means that
neutralizing it can be quite a bit of work.  It's not enough to
persuade yourself that it's happening; you have to marshal enough
evidence to persuade others too, and then you have to distribute that
evidence in a thoughtful way.</p><p>Given that it's so much work to fight, it's often better just to
tolerate it for a while.  Think of it like a parasitic but mild
disease: if it's not too debilitating, the project can afford to
remain infected, and medicine might have harmful side effects.
However, if it gets too damaging to tolerate, then it's time for
action.  Start gathering notes on the patterns you see.  Make sure to
include references to public archives&#8212;this is one of the reasons
the project keeps records, so you might as well use them.  Once you've
got a good case built, start having private conversations with other
project participants.  Don't tell them what you've observed; instead,
first ask them what they've observed.  This may be your last chance to
get unfiltered feedback about how others see the troublemaker's
behavior; once you start openly talking about it, opinion will
become polarized and no one will be able to remember what he
formerly thought about the matter.</p><p>If private discussions indicate that at least some others see
the problem too, then it's time to do something.  That's when you
have to get <span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> cautious, because it's very
easy for this sort of person to try to make it appear as though you're
picking on them unfairly.  Whatever you do, never accuse them of
maliciously abusing the project's procedures, of being paranoid, or, in
general, of any of the other things that you suspect are probably
true.  Your strategy should be to look both more reasonable and more
concerned with the overall welfare of the project, with the goal of
either reforming the person's behavior, or getting them to go away
permanently.  Depending on the other developers, and your relationship
with them, it may be advantageous to gather allies privately first.
Or it may not; that might just create ill will behind the scenes, if
people think you're engaging in an improper whispering
campaign.</p><p>Remember that although the other person may be the one behaving
destructively, <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> will be the one who appears
destructive if you make a public charge that you can't back up.  Be
sure to have plenty of examples to demonstrate what you're saying, and
say it as gently as possible while still being direct.  You may not
persuade the person in question, but that's okay as long as you
persuade everyone else.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Case study"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="difficult-people-case-study"></a>Case study</h3></div></div></div><p>I remember only one situation, in more than 10 years of working
in free software, where things got so bad that we actually had to ask
someone to stop posting altogether.  As is so often the case, he was
not rude, and sincerely wanted only to be helpful.  He just didn't
know when to post and when not to post.  Our lists were open to the
public, and he was posting so often, and asking questions on so many
different topics, that it was getting to be a noise problem for the
community.  We'd already tried asking him nicely to do a little more
research for answers before posting, but that had no effect.</p><p>The strategy that finally worked is a perfect example of how to
build a strong case on neutral, quantitative data.  One of our
developers did some digging in the archives, and then sent the
following message privately to a few developers.  The offender (the
third name on the list below, shown here as "J. Random") had very
little history with the project, and had contributed no code or
documentation.  Yet he was the third most active poster on the mailing
lists:</p><pre class="screen">
From: "Brian W. Fitzpatrick" &lt;fitz@collab.net&gt;
To: [... recipient list omitted for anonymity ...]
Subject: The Subversion Energy Sink
Date: Wed, 12 Nov 2003 23:37:47 -0600

In the last 25 days, the top 6 posters to the svn [dev|users] list have
been:

    294  kfogel@collab.net
    236  "C. Michael Pilato" &lt;cmpilato@collab.net&gt;
    220  "J. Random" &lt;jrandom@problematic-poster.com&gt;
    176  Branko &#268;ibej &lt;brane@xbc.nu&gt;
    130  Philip Martin &lt;philip@codematters.co.uk&gt;
    126  Ben Collins-Sussman &lt;sussman@collab.net&gt;

I would say that five of these people are contributing to Subversion
hitting 1.0 in the near future.

I would also say that one of these people is consistently drawing time
and energy from the other 5, not to mention the list as a whole, thus
(albeit unintentionally) slowing the development of Subversion.  I did
not do a threaded analysis, but vgrepping my Subversion mail spool tells
me that every mail from this person is responded to at least once by at
least 2 of the other 5 people on the above list.

I think some sort of radical intervention is necessary here, even if we
do scare the aforementioned person away.  Niceties and kindness have
already proven to have no effect.

dev@subversion is a mailing list to facilitate development of a version
control system, not a group therapy session.

-Fitz, attempting to wade through three days of svn mail that he let
 pile up
</pre><p>Though it might not seem so at first, J. Random's behavior was a
classic case of abusing project procedures.  He wasn't doing something
obvious like trying to filibuster a vote, but he was taking advantage
of the mailing list's policy of relying on self-moderation by its
members.  We left it to each individual's judgement when to post and
on what topics.  Thus, we had no procedural recourse for dealing with
someone who either did not have, or would not exercise, such judgement.
There was no rule one could point to and say the fellow was violating
it, yet everyone knew that his frequent posting was getting to be a
serious problem.</p><p>Fitz's strategy was, in retrospect, masterful.  He gathered
damning quantitative evidence, but then distributed it discreetly,
sending it first to a few people whose support would be key in any
drastic action.  They agreed that some sort of action was necessary,
and in the end we called J. Random on the phone, described the problem
to him directly, and asked him to simply stop posting.  He never
really did understand the reasons why; if he had been capable
of understanding, he probably would have exercised appropriate
judgement in the first place.  But he agreed to stop posting, and the
mailing lists became useable again.  Part of the reason this strategy
worked was, perhaps, the implicit threat that we could start
restricting his posts via the moderation software normally used for
preventing spam (see
<a class="xref" href="#spam-prevention" title="Unikanie spamu">&#8222;Unikanie spamu&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>).  But the
reason we were able to have that option in reserve was that Fitz had
gathered the necessary support from key people first.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Handling Growth"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="growth"></a>Handling Growth</h2></div></div></div><p>The price of success is heavy in the open source world.  As your
software gets more popular, the number of people who show up looking
for information increases dramatically, while the number of people
able to provide information increases much more slowly.  Furthermore,
even if the ratio were evenly balanced, there is still a fundamental
scalability problem with the way most open source projects handle
communications.  Consider mailing lists, for example.  Most projects
have a mailing list for general user questions&#8212;sometimes the
list's name is "users", "discuss", "help", or something else.
Whatever its name, the purpose of the list is always the same: to
provide a place where people can get their questions answered, while
others watch and (presumably) absorb knowledge from observing these
exchanges.</p><p>These mailing lists work very well up to a few thousand users
and/or a couple of hundred posts a day.  But somewhere after that, the
system starts to break down, because every subscriber sees every post;
if the number of posts to the list begins to exceed what any
individual reader can process in a day, the list becomes a burden to
its members.  Imagine, for instance, if Microsoft had such a mailing
list for Windows XP.  Windows XP has hundreds of millions of users; if
even one-tenth of one percent of them had questions in a given
twenty-four hour period, then this hypothetical list would get
hundreds of thousands of posts per day!  Such a list could never
exist, of course, because no one would stay subscribed to it.
This problem is not limited to mailing lists; the same logic applies
to IRC channels, online discussion forums, indeed to any system in
which a group hears questions from individuals.  The implications are
ominous: the usual open source model of massively parallelized support
simply does not scale to the levels needed for world
domination.</p><p>There will be no explosion when forums reach the breaking point.
There is just a quiet negative feedback effect: people unsubscribe
from the lists, or leave the IRC channel, or at any rate stop
bothering to ask questions, because they can see they won't be heard
in all the noise.  As more and more people make this highly rational
choice, the forum's activity will seem to stay at a manageable level.
But it is staying manageable precisely because the rational (or at
least experienced) people have started looking elsewhere for
information&#8212;while the inexperienced people stay behind and
continue posting.  In other words, one side effect of continuing to
use unscalable communications models as the project grows is that the
average quality of both questions and answers tends to go down, which
makes it look like new users are dumber than they used to be, when in
fact they're probably not.  It's just that the benefit/cost ratio of
using those high-population forums goes down, so naturally those with
the experience to do so start to look elsewhere for answers first.
Adjusting communications mechanisms to cope with project growth
therefore involves two related strategies:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Recognizing when particular parts of a forum are
            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> suffering unbounded growth, even
            if the forum as a whole is, and separating those parts
            off into new, more specialized forums (i.e., don't let
            the good be dragged down by the bad).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Making sure there are many automated sources
            of information available, and that they are kept
            organized, up-to-date, and easy to find.</p></li></ol></div><p>Strategy (1) is usually not too hard.  Most projects start out
with one main forum: a general discussion mailing list, on which
feature ideas, design questions, and coding problems can all be hashed
out.  Everyone involved with the project is on the list.  After a
while, it usually becomes clear that the list has evolved into several
distinct topic-based sublists.  For example, some threads are clearly
about development and design; others are user questions of the "How do
I do X?" variety; maybe there's a third topic family centered around
processing bug reports and enhancement requests; and so on.  A given
individual, of course, might participate in many different thread
types, but the important thing is that there is not a lot of overlap
between the types themselves.  They could be divided into separate
lists without causing any harmful balkanization, because the threads
rarely cross topic boundaries.</p><p>Actually doing this division is a two-step process.  You create
the new list (or IRC channel, or whatever it is to be), and then you
spend whatever time is necessary gently nagging and reminding people
to <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the new forums appropriately.  That latter
step can last for weeks, but eventually people will get the idea.  You
simply have to make a point of always telling the sender when a post
is sent to the wrong destination, and do so visibly, so that other
people are encouraged to help out with routing.  It's also useful to
have a web page providing a guide to all the lists available; your
responses can simply reference that web page and, as a bonus, the
recipient may learn something about looking for guidelines before
posting.</p><p>Strategy (2) is an ongoing process, lasting the lifetime of the
project and involving many participants.  Of course it is partly a
matter of having up-to-date documentation (see
<a class="xref" href="#documentation" title="Documentation">&#8222;Documentation&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Rozdzia&#322; 2. Zaczynamy">Rozdzia&#322; 2, <i>Zaczynamy</i></a></span>) and making sure to
point people there.  But it is also much more than that; the sections
that follow discuss this strategy in detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-archives"></a>Conspicuous Use of Archives</h3></div></div></div><p>Typically, all communications in an open source project (except
sometimes IRC conversations) are archived.  The archives are public
and searchable, and have referential stability: that is, once a given
piece of information is recorded at a particular address, it stays at
that address forever.</p><p>Use those archives as much as possible, and as conspicuously as
possible.  Even when you know the answer to some question off the top
of your head, if you think there's a reference in the archives that
contains the answer, spend the time to dig it up and present it.
Every time you do that in a publicly visible way, some people learn
for the first time that the archives are there, and that searching in
them can produce answers.  Also, by referring to the archives instead
of rewriting the advice, you reinforce the social norm against
duplicating information.  Why have the same answer in two different
places?  When the number of places it can be found is kept to a
minimum, people who have found it before are more likely to remember
what to search for to find it again.  Well-placed references also
contribute to the quality of search results in general, because they
strengthen the targeted resource's ranking in Internet search
engines.</p><p>There are times when duplicating information makes sense,
however.  For example, suppose there's a response already in the
archives, not from you, saying:</p><pre class="screen">
It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  To
unfrobnicate them, run these steps:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Run the 'defrobnicate' program that ships with Scanley.
3. Start up the server.
</pre><p>Then, months later, you see another post indicating that
someone's indexes have become frobnicated.  You search the archives
and come up with the old response above, but you realize it's missing
some steps (perhaps by mistake, or perhaps because the software has
changed since that post was written).  The classiest way to handle
this is to post a new, more complete set of instructions, and
explicitly obsolete the old post by mentioning it:</p><pre class="screen">
It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  We
saw this problem back in July, and J. Random posted a solution at
http://blahblahblah/blah.  Below is a more complete description of
how to unfrobnicate your indexes, based on J. Random's instructions
but extending them a bit:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Become the user the Scanley server normally runs as.
3. As that user, run the 'defrobnicate' program on the indexes.
4. Run Scanley by hand to see if the indexes work now.
5. Restart the server.
</pre><p>(In an ideal world, it would be possible to attach a note to the
old post, saying that there is newer information available and
pointing to the new post.  However, I don't know of any archiving
software that offers an "obsoleted by" feature, perhaps because it
would be mildly tricky to implement in a way that doesn't violate the
archives' integrity as a verbatim record.  This is another reason why
creating dedicated web pages with answers to common questions is a
good idea.)</p><p>Archives are probably most often searched for answers to
technical questions, but their importance to the project goes well
beyond that.  If a project's formal guidelines are its statutory law,
the archives are its common law: a record of all decisions made and
how they were arrived at.  In any recurring discussion, it's pretty
much obligatory nowadays to start with an archive search.  This allows
you to begin the discussion with a summary of the current state of
things, anticipate objections, prepare rebuttals, and possibly
discover angles you hadn't thought of.  Also, the other participants
will <span class="emphasis"><em>expect</em></span> you to have done an archive search.
Even if the previous discussions went nowhere, you should include
pointers to them when you re-raise the topic, so people can see for
themselves a) that they went nowhere, and b) that you did your
homework, and therefore are probably saying something now that has not
been said before.</p><div class="sect3" title="Treat all resources like archives"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="all-as-archives"></a>Treat all resources like archives</h4></div></div></div><p>All of the preceding advice applies to more than just mailing
list archives.  Having particular pieces of information at stable,
conveniently findable addresses should be an organizing principle for
all of the project's information.  Let's take the project FAQ as a
case study.</p><p>How do people use a FAQ?</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>They want to search in it for specific words and phrases.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They want to browse it, soaking up information without
          necessarily looking for answers to specific questions.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They expect search engines such as Google to know about the
          FAQ's content, so that searches can result in FAQ entries.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to refer other people directly to specific
          items in the FAQ.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to add new material to the FAQ, but
          note that this happens much less often than answers are

          written to.</p></li></ol></div><p>Point 1 implies that the FAQ should be available in some sort of
textual format.  Points 2 and 3 imply that the FAQ should be available
as an HTML page, with point 2 additionally indicating that the HTML
should be designed for readability (i.e., you'll want some control
over its look and feel), and should have a table of contents.  Point 4
means that each individual entry in the FAQ should be assigned an HTML
<em class="firstterm">named anchor</em>, a tag that allows people to reach
a particular location on the page.  Point 5 means the source files for
the FAQ should be available in a convenient way (see <a class="xref" href="#version-everything" title="Wersjonuj wszystko">&#8222;Wersjonuj wszystko&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>), in a format
that's easy to edit.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Named Anchors and ID Attributes"><a name="html-named-anchors-and-ids"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Named Anchors and ID Attributes</b></p></div></div></div><p>There are two ways to get a browser to jump to a specific
  location within a web page: named anchors and id attributes.</p><p>A <em class="firstterm">named anchor</em> is just a normal HTML
  anchor element (<code class="literal">&lt;a&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</code>), but with
  a "name" attribute:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;a name="mylabel"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>More recent versions of HTML support a generic <em class="firstterm">id
  attribute</em>, which can be attached to any HTML element,
  not just to <code class="literal">&lt;a&gt;</code>.  For example:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;p id="mylabel"&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;</pre><p>Both named anchors and id attributes are used in the same
  way.  One appends a hash mark and the label to a URL, to cause the
  browser to jump straight to that spot in the page:</p><pre class="screen">http://myproject.example.com/faq.html#mylabel</pre><p>Virtually all browsers support named anchors; most modern
  browsers support the id attribute.  To play it safe, I would
  recommend using either named anchors alone, or named anchors
  <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> id attributes together (with the same label
  for both in a given pair, of course).  Named anchors cannot be
  self-closing&#8212;even if there's no text inside the element, you
  must still write it in two-sided form:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;a name="mylabel"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>...though normally there would be some text, such as the title
  of a section.</p><p>Whether you use a named anchor, or an id attribute, or both,
  remember that the label will not be visible to someone who browses
  to that location without using the label.  But such a person might
  want to discover the label for a particular location, so they can
  mail the URL for a FAQ answer to a friend, for example.  To help
  them do this, add a <em class="firstterm">title attribute</em> to the
  same element(s) where you added the "name" and/or "id" attribute,
  for example:</p><pre class="screen">&lt;a name="mylabel" title="#mylabel"&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>When the mouse pointer is held over the text inside the
  title-attributed element, most browsers will pop up a tiny box
  showing the title.  I usually include the hash-sign, to remind the
  user that this is what she would put at the end of the URL to jump
  straight to this location next time.</p></div><p>Formatting the FAQ like this is just one example of how to make
a resource presentable.  The same properties&#8212;direct
searchability, availability to major Internet search engines,
browsability, referential stability, and (where applicable)
editability&#8212;apply to other web pages, the source code tree, the
bug tracker, etc.  It just happens that most mailing list archiving
software long ago recognized the importance of these properties, which
is why mailing lists tend to have this functionality natively, while
other formats may require some extra effort on the maintainer's part

each incoming participant must absorb increases.  Those who have been
with the project a long time were able to learn, and invent, the
project's conventions as they went along.  They will often not be
consciously aware of what a huge body of tradition has accumulated, and
may be surprised at how many missteps recent newcomers seem to make.
Of course, the issue is not that the newcomers are of any lower
quality than before; it's that they face a bigger acculturation burden
than newcomers did in the past.</p><p>The traditions a project accumulates are as much about how to
communicate and preserve information as they are about coding
standards and other technical minutae.  We've already looked at both
sorts of standards, in

examples are given there.  What this section is about is how to keep
such guidelines up-to-date as the project evolves, especially
guidelines about how communications are managed, because those are the
ones that change the most as the project grows in size and
complexity.</p><p>First, watch for patterns in how people get confused.  If you
see the same situations coming up over and over, especially with new
participants, chances are there is a guideline that needs to be
documented but isn't.  Second, don't get tired of saying the same
things over and over again, and don't <span class="emphasis"><em>sound</em></span> like
you're tired of saying them.  You and other project veterans will have
to repeat yourselves often; this is an inevitable side effect of the
arrival of newcomers.</p><p>Every web page, every mailing list message, and every IRC channel
should be considered advertising space&#8212;not for commercial
advertisements, but for ads about your project's own resources.  What
you put in that space depends on the demographics of those likely to
read it.  An IRC channel for user questions, for example, is likely to
get people who have never interacted with the project
before&#8212;often someone who has just installed the software, and
has a question he'd like answered immediately (after all, if it
could wait, he'd have sent it to a mailing list instead, which would
probably use less of his total time, although it would take longer
for an answer to come back).  People usually don't make a permanent
investment in the IRC channel; they'll show up, ask their question,
and leave.</p><p>Therefore, the channel topic should be aimed at people looking
for technical answers about the software <span class="emphasis"><em>right
now</em></span>, rather than at, say, people who might get involved
with the project in a long term way and for whom community interaction
guidelines might be more appropriate.  Here's how a really busy
channel handles it (compare this with the earlier example in

instructions there, and perhaps a pointer to the project's home page
or FAQ page as well.  You might think that anyone subscribed to the
list would know where to find those things, and they probably
do&#8212;but many more people than just subscribers see those mailing
list messages.  An archived post may be linked to from many places;
indeed, some posts become so widely known that they eventually have
more readers off the list than on it.</p><p>Formatting can make a big difference.  For example, in the
Subversion project, we were having limited success using the
bug-filtering technique described in
<a class="xref" href="#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">&#8222;Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>.  Many bogus
bug reports were still being filed by inexperienced people, and each
time it happened, the filer had to be educated in exactly the same way
as the 500 people before him.  One day, after one of our developers had
finally gotten to the end of his rope and flamed some poor user who
didn't read the issue tracker guidelines carefully enough, another
developer decided this pattern had gone on long enough.  He suggested
that we reformat the issue tracker front page so that the most
important part, the injunction to discuss the bug on the mailing lists
or IRC channels before filing, would stand out in huge, bold red
letters, on a bright yellow background, centered prominently above
everything else on the page.  We did so (you can see the results at
<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_issues.html" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/project_issues.html</a>), and
the result was a noticeable drop in the rate of bogus issue filings.
We still get them, of course&#8212;we always will&#8212;but the rate
has slowed considerably, even as the number of users increases.  The
outcome is not only that the bug database contains less junk, but that
those who respond to issue filings stay in a better mood, and are more
likely to remain friendly when responding to one of the now-rare bogus
filings.  This improves both the project's image and the mental health
of its volunteers.</p><p>The lesson for us was that merely writing up the guidelines was
not enough.  We also had to put them where they'd be seen by those who
need them most, and format them in such a way that their status as
introductory material would be immediately clear to people unfamiliar
with the project.</p><p>Static web pages are not the only venue for advertising the
project's customs.  A certain amount of interactive policing (in the
friendly-reminder sense, not the handcuffs-and-jail sense) is also
required.  All peer review, even the commit reviews described in
<a class="xref" href="#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">&#8222;Practice Conspicuous Code Review&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Rozdzia&#322; 2. Zaczynamy">Rozdzia&#322; 2, <i>Zaczynamy</i></a></span>, should include review
of people's conformance or non-conformance with project norms,
especially with regard to communications conventions.</p><p>Another example from the Subversion project: we settled on a
convention of "r12908" to mean "revision 12908 in the version control
repository."  The lower-case "r" prefix is easy to type, and because
it's half the height of the digits, it makes an easily-recognizable
block of text when combined with the digits.  Of course, settling on
the convention doesn't mean that everyone will begin using it
consistently right away.  Thus, when a commit mail comes in with a log
message like this:</p><pre class="screen">

Patch from J. Random Contributor &lt;jrcontrib@gmail.com&gt;

* trunk/contrib/client-side/psvn/psvn.el:
  Fixed some typos from revision 12828.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>...part of reviewing that commit is to say "By the way, please
use 'r12828', not 'revision 12828' when referring to past changes."
This isn't just pedantry; it's important as much for automatic
parsability as for human readership.</p><p>By following the general principle that there should be
canonical referral methods for common entities, and that these
referral methods should be used consistently everywhere, the project
in effect exports certain standards.  Those standards enable people to
write tools that present the project's communications in more useable
ways&#8212;for example, a revision formatted as "r12828" could be
transformed into a live link into the repository browsing system.
This would be harder to do if the revision were written as "revision
12828", both because that form could be divided across a line break,
and because it's less distinct (the word "revision" will often appear
alone, and groups of numbers will often appear alone, whereas the
combination "r12828" can only mean a revision number).  Similar
concerns apply to issue numbers, FAQ items (hint: use a URL with a
named anchor, as described in
<a class="xref" href="#html-named-anchors-and-ids" title="Named Anchors and ID Attributes">Named Anchors and ID Attributes</a>), etc.</p><p>Even for entities where there is not an obvious short, canonical
form, people should still be encouraged to provide key pieces of
information consistently.  For example, when referring to a mailing
list message, don't just give the sender and subject; also give the
archive URL <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the Message-ID header.  The last
allows people who have their own copy of the mailing list (people
sometimes keep offline copies, for example to use on a laptop while
traveling) to unambiguously identify the right message even if they
don't have access to the archives.  The sender and subject wouldn't be
enough, because the same person might make several posts in the same
thread, even on the same day.</p><p>The more a project grows, the more important this sort of
consistency becomes.  Consistency means that everywhere people look,
they see the same patterns being followed, so they know to follow
those patterns themselves.  This, in turn, reduces the number of
questions they need to ask.  The burden of having a million readers is
no greater than that of having one; scalability problems start to
arise only when a certain percentage of those readers ask questions.
As a project grows, therefore, it must reduce that percentage by
increasing the density and accessibility of information, so that any
given person is more likely to find what he needs without having to
ask.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="No Conversations in the Bug Tracker"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="bug-tracker-usage"></a>No Conversations in the Bug Tracker</h2></div></div></div><p>In any project that's making active use of its bug tracker,
there is always a danger of the tracker turning into a discussion
forum itself, even though the mailing lists would really be better.
Usually it starts off innocently enough: someone annotates an issue
with, say, a proposed solution, or a partial patch.  Someone else sees
this, realizes there are problems with the solution, and attaches
another annotation pointing out the problems.  The first person
responds, again by appending to the issue...and so it goes.</p><p>The problem with this is, first, that the bug tracker is a
pretty cumbersome place to have a discussion, and second, that other
people may not be paying attention&#8212;after all, they expect
development discussion to happen on the development mailing list, so
that's where they look for it.  They may not be subscribed to the
issue changes list at all, and even if they are, they may not follow it
very closely.</p><p>But exactly where in the process did something go wrong?  Was it
when the original person attached her solution to the
issue&#8212;should she have posted it to the list instead?  Or was it
when the second person responded in the issue, instead of on the
list?</p><p>There isn't one right answer, but there is a general principle:
if you're just adding data to an issue, then do it in the tracker, but
if you're starting a <span class="emphasis"><em>conversation</em></span>, then do it on
the mailing list.  You may not always be able to tell which is the
case, but just use your best judgement.  For example, when attaching a
patch that contains a potentially controversial solution, you might be
able to anticipate that people are going to have questions about it.
So even though you would normally attach the patch to the issue
(assuming you don't want to or can't commit the change directly), in
this case you might choose to post it to a mailing list instead.  At
any rate, there eventually will come a point in the exchange where one
party or the other can tell that it is about to go from mere appending
of data to an actual conversation&#8212;in the example that started
this section, that would be the second respondent, who on realizing
that there were problems with the patch, could predict that a real
conversation is about to ensue, and therefore that it should be held
in the appropriate medium.</p><p>To use a mathematical analogy, if the information looks like it
will be quickly convergent, then put it directly in the bug tracker;
if it looks like it will be divergent, then a mailing list or IRC
channel would be a better place.</p><p>This doesn't mean there should never be any exchanges in the
bug tracker.  Asking for more details of the reproduction recipe
from the original reporter tends to be a highly convergent process,
for instance.  The person's response is unlikely to raise new issues;
it's simply going to flesh out information already filed.  There's no
need to distract the mailing list with that process; by all means,
take care of it with a series of comments in the tracker.  Likewise,
if you're fairly sure that the bug has been misreported (i.e., is not
a bug), then you can simply say so right in the issue.  Even pointing
out a minor problem with a proposed solution is fine, assuming the
problem is not a showstopper for the entire solution.</p><p>On the other hand, if you're raising philosophical issues about
the bug's scope or the software's proper behavior, you can be pretty
sure other developers will want to be involved.  The discussion is
likely to diverge for a while before it converges, so do it on the
mailing list.</p><p>Always link to the mailing list thread from the issue, when you
choose to post to the mailing list.  It's still important for someone
following the issue to be able to reach the discussion, even if the
issue itself isn't the forum of discussion.  The person who starts the
thread may find this laborious, but open source is fundamentally a
writer-responsible culture: it's much more important to make things
easy for the tens or hundreds of people who may read the bug than for
the three or five people writing about it.</p><p>It's fine to take important conclusions or summaries from the
list discussion and paste them into the issue, if that will make
things convenient for readers.  A common idiom is to start a list
discussion, put a link to the thread in the issue, and then when the
discussion finishes, paste the final summary into the issue (along
with a link to the message containing that summary), so someone
browsing the issue can easily see what conclusion was reached without
having to click to somewhere else.  Note that the usual "two masters"
data duplication problem does not exist here, because both archives
and issue comments are usually static, unchangeable data
anyway.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Publicity"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="publicity"></a>Publicity</h2></div></div></div><p>In free software, there is a fairly smooth continuum between
purely internal discussions and public relations statements.  This is
partly because the target audience is always ill-defined: given that
most or all posts are publicly accessible, the project doesn't have
full control over the impression the world gets.  Someone&#8212;say, a
<a class="ulink" href="slashdot.org" target="_top">slashdot.org</a> editor&#8212;may draw millions of readers'
attention to a post that no one ever expected to be seen outside the
project.  This is a fact of life that all open source projects live
with, but in practice, the risk is usually small.  In general, the
announcements that the project most wants publicized are the ones that
will be most publicized, assuming you use the right mechanisms to
indicate relative newsworthiness to the outside world.</p><p>For major announcements, there tend to be four or five main
channels of distribution, on which announcements should be made as
nearly simultaneously as possible:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Your project's front page is probably seen by more
            people than any other part of the project.  If you have a
            really major announcement, put a blurb there.  The blurb
            should be a very brief synopsis that links to the press
            release (see below) for more information.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>At the same time, you should also have a "News" or
            "Press Releases" area of the web site, where the
            announcement can be written up in detail.  Part of the
            purpose of a press release is to provide a single,
            canonical "announcement object" that other sites can link
            to, so make sure it is structured accordingly: either as
            one web page per release, as a discrete blog entry, or
            as some other kind of entity that can be linked to while
            still being kept distinct from other press releases in the
            same area.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If your project has an RSS feed, make sure the
            announcement goes out there too.  This may happen
            automatically when you create the press release, depending
            on how things are set up at your site.
            (<em class="firstterm">RSS</em> is a mechanism for
            distributing meta-data-rich news summaries to
            "subscribers", that is, people who have indicated an
            interest in receiving those summaries.  See
     <a class="ulink" href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html" target="_top">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html</a>
            for more information about RSS.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If the announcement is about a new release of the
            software, then update your project's entry on
            <a class="ulink" href="http://freshmeat.net/" target="_top">http://freshmeat.net/</a> (see
            <a class="xref" href="#announcing" title="Announcing">&#8222;Announcing&#8221;</a> about creating the entry
            in the first place).  Every time you update a Freshmeat
            entry, that entry goes onto the Freshmeat change list
            for the day.  The change list is updated not only on
            Freshmeat itself, but on various portal sites (including
            <a class="ulink" href="slashdot.org" target="_top">slashdot.org</a>) which are watched eagerly by
            hordes of people.  Freshmeat also offers the same data via
            RSS feed, so people who are not subscribed to your
            project's own RSS feed might still see the announcement
            via Freshmeat's.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Send a mail to your project's announcement mailing
            list.  This list's name should actually be "announce",
            that is, <code class="literal">announce@yourprojectdomain.org</code>,
            because that's a fairly standard convention now, and the
            list's charter should make it clear that it is very
            low-traffic, reserved for major project announcements.
            Most of those announcements will be about new releases of
            the software, but occasionally other events, such as a
            fundraising drive, the discovery of a security
            vulnerability (see
            <a class="xref" href="#security" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">&#8222;Announcing Security Vulnerabilities&#8221;</a>)<span>
            later in this chapter</span>, or a
            major shift in project direction may be posted there as
            well.  Because it is low traffic and used only for
            important things, the <code class="literal">announce</code> list
            typically has the highest subscribership of any mailing
            list in the project (of course, this means you shouldn't
            abuse it&#8212;consider carefully before posting).  To
            avoid random people making announcements, or worse, spam
            getting through, the <code class="literal">announce</code> list must
            always be moderated.</p></li></ol></div><p>Try to make the announcements in all these places at the same
time, as nearly as possible.  People might get confused if they see an
announcement on the mailing list but then don't see it reflected on
the project's home page or in its press releases area.  If you get the
various changes (emails, web page edits, etc.) queued up and
then send them all in a row, you can keep the window of inconsistency
very small.</p><p>For a less important event, you can eliminate some or all of the
above outlets.  The event will still be noticed by the outside world
in direct proportion to its importance.  For example, while a new
release of the software is a major event, merely setting the date of
the next release, while still somewhat newsworthy, is not nearly as
important as the release itself.  Setting a date is worth an email to
the daily mailing lists (not the announce list), and an update of the
project's timeline or status web page, but no more.</p><p>However, you might still see that date appearing in discussions
elsewhere on the Internet, wherever there are people interested in the
project.  People who are lurkers on your mailing lists, just listening
and never saying anything, are not necessarily silent elsewhere.  Word
of mouth gives very broad distribution; you should count on it, and
construct even minor announcements in such a way as to encourage
accurate informal transmission.  Specifically, posts that you expect
to be quoted should have a clearly meant-to-be-quoted portion, just as
though you were writing a formal press release.  For example:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Just a progress update: we're planning to release
     version 2.0 of Scanley in mid-August 2005.  You can always check
     http://www.scanley.org/status.html for updates.  The major new
     feature will be regular-expression searches.</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Other new features include: ... There will
     also be various bugfixes, including: ...</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The first paragraph is short, gives the two most important
pieces of information (the release date and the major new feature),
and a URL to visit for further news.  If that paragraph is the only
thing that crosses someone's screen, you're still doing pretty well.
The rest of the mail could be lost without affecting the gist of the
content.  Of course, sometimes people will link to the entire mail
anyway, but just as often, they'll quote only a small part.  Given that
the latter is a possibility, you might as well make it easy for them,
and in the bargain get some influence over what gets quoted.</p><div class="sect2" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="security"></a>Announcing Security Vulnerabilities</h3></div></div></div><p>Handling a security vulnerability is different from handling any
other kind of bug report.  In free software, doing things openly and
transparently is normally almost a religious credo.  Every step of the
standard bug-handling process is visible to all who care to watch: the
arrival of the initial report, the ensuing discussion, and the
eventual fix.</p><p>Security bugs are different.  They can compromise users' data,
and possibly users' entire computers.  To discuss such a problem
openly would be to advertise its existence to the entire
world&#8212;including to all the parties who might make malicious use
of the bug.  Even merely committing a fix effectively announces the
bug's existence (there are potential attackers who watch the commit
logs of public projects, systematically looking for changes that
indicate security problems in the pre-change code).  Most open source
projects have settled on approximately the same set of steps to handle
this conflict between openness and secrecy, based on the these basic
guidelines:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Don't talk about the bug publicly until a fix is
            available; then supply the fix at exactly the same moment
            you announce the bug.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Come up with that fix as fast as you
            can&#8212;especially if someone outside the project
            reported the bug, because then you know there's at least
            one person outside the project who is able to exploit the
            vulnerability.</p></li></ol></div><p>In practice, those principles lead to a fairly standardized
series of steps, which are described in the sections below.</p><div class="sect3" title="Receive the report"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-receiving"></a>Receive the report</h4></div></div></div><p>Obviously, a project needs the ability to receive security bug
reports from anyone.  But the regular bug reporting address won't do,
because it can be watched by anyone too.  Therefore, have a separate
mailing list for receiving security bug reports.  That mailing list
must not have publicly readable archives, and its subscribership must
be strictly controlled&#8212;only long-time, trusted developers can be
on the list.  If you need a formal definition of "trusted", you can
use "anyone who has had commit access for two years or more" or
something like that, to avoid favoritism.  This is the group that will
handle security bugs.</p><p>Ideally, the security list should not be spam-protected or
moderated, since you don't want an important report to get filtered
out or delayed just because no moderators happened to be online that
weekend.  If you do use automated spam-protection software, try to
configure it with high-tolerance settings; it's better to let a few spams
through than to miss a report.  For the list to be effective, you must
advertise its address, of course; but given that it will be unmoderated
and, at most, lightly spam-protected, try to never to post its address
without some sort of address hiding transformation, as described in
<a class="xref" href="#address-hiding" title="Ukrywanie adresów w archiwach">&#8222;Ukrywanie adresów w archiwach&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>.
Fortunately, address-hiding need not make the address illegible; see
<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/security.html" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/security.html</a>, and view
that page's HTML source, for an example.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Develop the fix quietly"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-finding-a-fix"></a>Develop the fix quietly</h4></div></div></div><p>So what does the security list do when it receives a report?
The first task is to evaluate the problem's severity and
urgency:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>How serious is the vulnerability?  Does it allow a
            malicious attacker to take over the computer of someone
            who uses your software?  Or does it, say, merely leak
            information about the sizes of some of their files?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>How easy is it to exploit the vulnerability?  Can
            an attack be scripted, or does it require circumstantial
            knowledge, educated guessing, and luck?</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Who</em></span> reported the problem to
            you?  The answer to this question doesn't change the
            nature of the vulnerability, of course, but it does give
            you an idea of how many other people might know about it.
            If the report comes from one of the project's own
            developers, you can breathe a little easier (but only a
            little), because you can trust them not to have told
            anyone else about it.  On the other hand, if it came in an
            email from <code class="literal">anonymous14@globalhackerz.net</code>,
            then you'd better act as fast as you can.  The person did
            you a favor by informing you of the problem at all, but you
            have no idea how many other people she's told, or how long
            she'll wait before exploiting the vulnerability on live
            installations.</p></li></ol></div><p>Note that the difference we're talking about here is often just
a narrow range between <span class="emphasis"><em>urgent</em></span>
and <span class="emphasis"><em>extremely urgent</em></span>.  Even when the report
comes from a known, friendly source, there could be other people on
the Net who discovered the bug long ago and just haven't reported it.
The only time things aren't urgent is when the bug inherently does not
compromise security very severely.</p><p>The "<code class="literal">anonymous14@globalhackerz.net</code>" example
is not facetious, by the way.  You really may get bug reports from
identity-cloaked people who, by their words and behavior, never quite
clarify whether they're on your side or not.  It doesn't matter: if
they've reported the security hole to you, they'll feel they've done
you a good turn, and you should respond in kind.  Thank them for the
report, give them a date on or before which you plan to release a
public fix, and keep them in the loop.  Sometimes they may
give <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> a date&#8212;that is, an implicit threat
to publicize the bug on a certain date, whether you're ready or not.
This may feel like a bullying power play, but it's more likely a
preëmptive action resulting from past disappointment with
unresponsive software producers who didn't take security reports
seriously enough.  Either way, you can't afford to tick this person
off.  After all, if the bug is severe, he has knowledge that could
cause your users big problems.  Treat such reporters well, and hope
that they treat you well.</p><p>Another frequent reporter of security bugs is the security
professional, someone who audits code for a living and keeps up on the
latest news of software vulnerabilities.  These people usually have
experience on both sides of the fence&#8212;they've both received and
sent reports, probably more than most developers in your project have.
They too will usually give a deadline for fixing a vulnerability
before going public.  The deadline may be somewhat negotiable, but
that's up to the reporter; deadlines have become recognized among
security professionals as pretty much the only reliable way to get
organizations to address security problems promptly.  So don't treat
the deadline as rude; it's a time-honored tradition, and there are
good reasons for it.</p><p>Once you know the severity and urgency, you can start working on
a fix.  There is sometimes a tradeoff between doing a fix elegantly
and doing it speedily; this is why you must agree on the urgency
before you start.  Keep discussion of the fix restricted to the
security list members, of course, plus the original reporter (if she
wants to be involved) and any developers who need to be brought in for
technical reasons.</p><p>Do not commit the fix to the repository.  Keep it in patch form
until the go-public date.  If you were to commit it, even with an
innocent-looking log message, someone might notice and understand the
change.  You never know who is watching your repository and why they
might be interested.  Turning off commit emails wouldn't help; first
of all, the gap in the commit mail sequence would itself look
suspicious, and anyway, the data would still be in the repository.
Just do all development in a patch and keep the patch in some private
place, perhaps a separate, private repository known only to the people
already aware of the bug.  (If you use a decentralized version control
system like Arch or SVK, you can do the work under full version
control, and just keep that repository inaccessible to
outsiders.)</p></div><div class="sect3" title="CAN/CVE numbers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-cve"></a>CAN/CVE numbers</h4></div></div></div><p>You may have seen a <em class="firstterm">CAN number</em> or
a <em class="firstterm">CVE number</em> associated with security problems.
These numbers usually look like "CAN-2004-0397" or
"CVE-2002-0092", for example.</p><p>Both kinds of numbers represent the same type of entity: an
entry in the list of "Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures" list
maintained at <a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/" target="_top">http://cve.mitre.org/</a>.  The purpose of
the list is to provide standardized names for all known security
problems, so that everyone has a unique, canonical name to use when
discussing one, and a central place to go to find out more
information.  The only difference between a "CAN" number and a "CVE"
number is that the former represents a candidate entry, not yet
approved for inclusion in the official list by the CVE Editorial
Board, and the latter represents an approved entry.  However, both
types of entries are visible to the public, and an entry's number does
not change when it is approved&#8212;the "CAN" prefix is simply
replaced with "CVE".</p><p>A CAN/CVE entry does not itself contain a full description of
the bug and how to protect against it.  Instead, it contains a brief
summary, and a list of references to external resources (such as
mailing list archives) where people can go to get more detailed
information.  The real purpose of <a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/" target="_top">http://cve.mitre.org/</a>
is to provide a well-organized space in which every vulnerability can
have a name and a clear route to more data.  See
<a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2002-0092" target="_top">http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2002-0092</a>
for an example of an entry.  Note that the references can be very
terse, with sources appearing as cryptic abbreviations.  A key to
those abbreviations is at
<a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/cve/refs/refkey.html" target="_top">http://cve.mitre.org/cve/refs/refkey.html</a>.</p><p>If your vulnerability meets the CVE criteria, you may wish to
acquire it a CAN number.  The process for doing so is deliberately
gated: basically, you have to know someone, or know someone who knows
someone.  This is not as crazy as it might sound.  In order for the
CVE Editorial Board to avoid being overwhelmed with spurious or
poorly written submissions, they take submissions only from sources
they already know and trust.  In order to get your vulnerability
listed, therefore, you need to find a path of acquaintance from your
project to the CVE Editorial Board.  Ask around among your developers;
one of them will probably know someone else who has either done the
CAN process before, or knows someone who has, etc.  The advantage of
doing it this way is also that somewhere along the chain, someone may
know enough to tell you that a) it wouldn't count as a vulnerability
or exposure according to MITRE's criteria, so there is no point
submitting it, or b) the vulnerability already
<span class="emphasis"><em>has</em></span> a CAN or CVE number.  The latter can happen
if the bug has already been published on another security advisory
list, for example at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cert.org/" target="_top">http://www.cert.org/</a> or on the
BugTraq mailing list at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.securityfocus.com/" target="_top">http://www.securityfocus.com/</a>.
(If that happened without your project hearing about it, then you
should worry what else might be going on that you don't know
about.)</p><p>If you get a CAN/CVE number at all, you usually want to get it
in the early stages of your bug investigation, so that all further
communications can refer to that number.  CAN entries are embargoed
until the go-public date; the entry will exist as an empty placeholder
(so you don't lose the name), but it won't reveal any information
about the vulnerability until the date on which you will be announcing
the bug and the fix.</p><p>More information about the CAN/CVE process may be found at
<a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/about/candidates.html" target="_top">http://cve.mitre.org/about/candidates.html</a>, and a
particularly clear exposition of one open source project's use of
CAN/CVE numbers is at

are on the security mailing list, or who have been brought in to deal
with a particular report) has a fix ready, you need to decide how to
distribute it.</p><p>If you simply commit the fix to your repository, or otherwise
announce it to the world, you effectively force everyone using your
software to upgrade immediately or risk being hacked.  It is sometimes
appropriate, therefore, to do <em class="firstterm">pre-notification</em>
for certain important users.  This is particularly true with
client/server software, where there may be well-known servers that are
tempting targets for attackers.  Those servers' administrators would
appreciate having an extra day or two to do the upgrade, so that they
are already protected by the time the exploit becomes public
knowledge.</p><p>Pre-notification simply means sending mails to those
administrators before the go-public date, telling them of the
vulnerability and how to fix it.  You should send pre-notification
only to people you trust to be discreet with the information.  That
is, the qualification for receiving pre-notification is twofold: the
recipient must run a large, important server where a compromise would
be a serious matter, <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the recipient must be
known to be someone who won't blab about the security problem before
the go-public date.</p><p>Send each pre-notification mail individually (one at a time) to
each recipient.  Do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> send to the entire list
of recipients at once, because then they would see each others'
names&#8212;meaning that you would essentially be alerting each
recipient to the fact that each <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> recipient
may have a security hole in her server.  Sending it to them all via
blind CC (BCC) isn't a good solution either, because some admins
protect their inboxes with spam filters that either block or reduce
the priority of BCC'd mail, since so much spam is sent via BCC these
days.</p><p>Here's a sample pre-notification mail:</p><pre class="screen">
From: Your Name Here

Reply-to: Your Name Here (not the security list's address)
Subject: Confidential Scanley vulnerability notification.


This email is a confidential pre-notification of a security alert
in the Scanley server.

Please *do not forward* any part of this mail to anyone.  The public
announcement is not until May 19th, and we'd like to keep the
information embargoed until then.

You are receiving this mail because (we think) you run a Scanley
server, and would want to have it patched before this security hole is
made public on May 19th.

===========

   CAN-2004-1771: Scanley stack overflow in queries

Vulnerability:
==============

   The server can be made to run arbitrary commands if the server's
   locale is misconfigured and the client sends a malformed query.

Severity:
=========

   Very severe, can involve arbitrary code execution on the server.

Workarounds:
============

   Setting the 'natural-language-processing' option to 'off' in
   scanley.conf closes this vulnerability.

Patch:
======

   The patch below applies to Scanley 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2.

   A new public release (Scanley 3.2.1) will be made on or just before
   May 19th, so that it is available at the same time as this
   vulnerability is made public.  You can patch now, or just wait for
   the public release.  The only difference between 3.2 and 3.2.1 will
   be this patch.

[...patch goes here...]
</pre><p>If you have a CAN number, include it in the pre-notification (as
shown above), even though the information is still embargoed and
therefore the MITRE page will show nothing.  Including the CAN number
allows the recipient to know with certainty that the bug they were
pre-notified about is the same one they later hear about through
public channels, so they don't have to worry whether further action is
necessary or not, which is precisely the point of CAN/CVE
numbers.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Distribute the fix publicly"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="security-announcing"></a>Distribute the fix publicly</h4></div></div></div><p>The last step in handling a security bug is to distribute the
fix publicly.  In a single, comprehensive announcement, you should
describe the problem, give the CAN/CVE number if any, describe how to
work around it, and how to permanently fix it.  Usually "fix" means
upgrading to a new version of the software, though sometimes it can
mean applying a patch, particularly if the software is normally run in
source form anyway.  If you do make a new release, it should differ
from some existing release by exactly the security patch.  That way,
conservative admins can upgrade without worrying about what else they
might be affecting; they also don't have to worry about future upgrades,
because the security fix will be in all future releases as a matter of
course.  (Details of release procedures are discussed in
<a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">&#8222;Security Releases&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#development-cycle" title="Rozdzia&#322; 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Rozdzia&#322; 7, <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>.)</p><p>Whether or not the public fix involves a new release, do the
announcement with roughly the same priority as you would a new
release: send a mail to the project's <code class="literal">announce</code>
list, make a new press release, update the Freshmeat entry, etc.
While you should never try to play down the existence of a security
bug out of concern for the project's reputation, you may certainly set
the tone and prominence of a security announcement to match the actual
severity of the problem.  If the security hole is just a minor
information exposure, not an exploit that allows the user's entire
computer to be taken over, then it may not warrant a lot of fuss.  You
may even decide not to distract the <code class="literal">announce</code> list
with it.  After all, if the project cries wolf every time, users might
end up thinking the software is less secure than it actually is, and
also might not believe you when you have a really big problem to
announce.  See
<a class="ulink" href="http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html" target="_top">http://cve.mitre.org/about/terminology.html</a> for a good
introduction to the problem of judging severity.</p><p>In general, if you're unsure how to treat a security problem,
find someone with experience and talk to them about it.  Assessing and
handling vulnerabilities is very much an acquired skill, and it's easy
to make missteps the first few times.</p></div></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp7899904" href="#idp7899904" class="para">22</a>] </sup>There

release their software, and how overall development patterns organize
around those goals.</p><p>A major difference between open source projects and proprietary
ones is the lack of centralized control over the development team.
When a new release is being prepared, this difference is especially
stark: a corporation can ask its entire development team to focus on
an upcoming release, putting aside new feature development and
non-critical bug fixing until the release is done.  Volunteer groups
are not so monolithic.  People work on the project for all sorts of
reasons, and those not interested in helping with a given release
still want to continue regular development work while the release is
going on.  Because development doesn't stop, open source release
processes tend to take longer, but be less disruptive, than commercial
release processes.  It's a bit like highway repair.  There are two
ways to fix a road: you can shut it down completely, so that a repair
crew can swarm all over it at full capacity until the problem is
solved, or you can work on a couple of lanes at a time, while leaving the
others open to traffic.  The first way is very efficient <span class="emphasis"><em>for
the repair crew</em></span>, but not for anyone else&#8212;the road is
entirely shut down until the job is done.  The second way involves
much more time and trouble for the repair crew (now they have to work
with fewer people and less equipment, in cramped conditions, with
flaggers to slow and direct traffic, etc.), but at least the road
remains useable, albeit not at full capacity.</p><p>Open source projects tend to work the second way.  In fact, for
a mature piece of software with several different release lines being
maintained simultaneously, the project is sort of in a permanent state
of minor road repair.  There are always a couple of lanes closed; a
consistent but low level of background inconvenience is always being
tolerated by the development group as a whole, so that releases get
made on a regular schedule.</p><p>The model that makes this possible generalizes to more than just
releases.  It's the principle of parallelizing tasks that are not
mutually interdependent&#8212;a principle that is by no means unique
to open source development, of course, but one which open source
projects implement in their own particular way.  They cannot afford to
annoy either the roadwork crew or the regular traffic too much, but
they also cannot afford to have people dedicated to standing by the
orange cones and flagging traffic along.  Thus they gravitate toward
processes that have flat, constant levels of administrative overhead,
rather than peaks and valleys.  Volunteers are generally willing to
work with small but consistent amounts of inconvenience; the
predictability allows them to come and go without worrying about
whether their schedule will clash with what's happening in the
project.  But if the project were subject to a master schedule in
which some activities excluded other activities, the result would be a
lot of developers sitting idle a lot of the time&#8212;which would be
not only inefficient but boring, and therefore dangerous, in that a
bored developer is likely to soon be an ex-developer.</p><p>Release work is usually the most noticeable non-development task
that happens in parallel with development, so the methods described in
the following sections are geared mostly toward enabling releases.
However, note that they also apply to other parallelizable tasks, such
as translations and internationalization, broad API changes made
gradually across the entire code base, etc.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Release Numbering"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="release-numbering"></a>Release Numbering</h2></div></div></div><p>Before we talk about how to make a release, let's look at how to
name releases, which requires knowing what releases actually mean to
users.  A release means that:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Old bugs have been fixed.  This is probably the one
            thing users can count on being true of every release.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>New bugs have been added.  This too can usually
            be counted on, except sometimes in the case of security
            releases or other one-offs (see
            <a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">&#8222;Security Releases&#8221;</a><span> later in this chapter</span>).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>New features may have been added.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>New configuration options may have been added, or
            the meanings of old options may have changed subtly.  The
            installation procedures may have changed slightly since
            the last release too, though one always hopes not.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Incompatible changes may have been introduced, such
            that the data formats used by older versions of the
            software are no longer useable without undergoing some
            sort of (possibly manual) one-way conversion step.</p></li></ul></div><p>As you can see, not all of these are good things.  This is why
experienced users approach new releases with some trepidation,
especially when the software is mature and was already mostly doing
what they wanted (or thought they wanted).  Even the arrival of new
features is a mixed blessing, in that it may mean the software
will now behave in unexpected ways.</p><p>The purpose of release numbering, therefore, is twofold:
obviously the numbers should unambiguously communicate the ordering of
releases (i.e., by looking at any two releases' numbers, one can know
which came later), but also they should indicate as compactly as
possible the degree and nature of the changes in the release.</p><p>All that in a number?  Well, more or less, yes.  Release
numbering strategies are one of the oldest bikeshed discussions around
(see <a class="xref" href="#bikeshed" title="The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate">&#8222;The Softer the Topic, the Longer the Debate&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>), and the world is
unlikely to settle on a single, complete standard anytime soon.
However, a few good strategies have emerged, along with one
universally agreed-on principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>be consistent</em></span>.
Pick a numbering scheme, document it, and stick with it.  Your users
will thank you.</p><div class="sect2" title="Release Number Components"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release-number-components"></a>Release Number Components</h3></div></div></div><p>This section describes the formal conventions of release
numbering in detail, and assumes very little prior knowledge.  It is
intended mainly as a reference.  If you're already familiar with these
conventions, you can skip this section.</p><p>Release numbers are groups of digits separated by dots:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley 2.3<br>
Singer 5.11.4</p></div></div><p>...and so on.  The dots are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> decimal
points, they are merely separators; "5.3.9" would be followed by
"5.3.10".  A few projects have occasionally hinted otherwise, most
famously the Linux kernel with its "0.95", "0.96"... "0.99" sequence
leading up to Linux 1.0, but the convention that the dots are not
decimals is now firmly established and should be considered a
standard.  There is no limit to the number of components (digit
portions containing no dots), but most projects do not go beyond three
or four.  The reasons why will become clear later.</p><p>In addition to the numeric components, projects sometimes tack
on a descriptive label such as "Alpha" or "Beta" (see
<a class="xref" href="#alpha-and-beta" title="Alpha and Beta">Alpha and Beta</a>), for example:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley 2.3.0 (Alpha)<br>
Singer 5.11.4 (Beta)</p></div></div><p>An Alpha or Beta qualifier means that this
release <span class="emphasis"><em>precedes</em></span> a future release that will have
the same number without the qualifier.  Thus, "2.3.0 (Alpha)"
leads eventually to "2.3.0".  In order to allow several such candidate
releases in a row, the qualifiers themselves can have meta-qualifiers.
For example, here is a series of releases in the order that they would
be made available to the public:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>Scanley 2.3.0 (Alpha 1)<br>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Alpha 2)<br>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 1)<br>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 2)<br>
Scanley 2.3.0 (Beta 3)<br>
Scanley 2.3.0</p></div></div><p>Notice that when it has the "Alpha" qualifier, Scanley "2.3" is
written as "2.3.0".  The two numbers are equivalent&#8212;trailing
all-zero components can always be dropped for brevity&#8212;but when a
qualifier is present, brevity is out the window anyway, so one might
as well go for completeness instead.</p><p>Other qualifiers in semi-regular use include "Stable",
"Unstable", "Development", and "RC" (for "Release Candidate").  The
most widely used ones are still "Alpha" and "Beta", with "RC" running
a close third place, but note that "RC" always includes a numeric
meta-qualifier.  That is, you don't release
"Scanley 2.3.0 (RC)", you release
"Scanley 2.3.0 (RC 1)", followed by RC2, etc.</p><p>Those three labels, "Alpha", "Beta", and "RC", are pretty widely
known now, and I don't recommend using any of the others, even though
the others might at first glance seem like better choices because they
are normal words, not jargon.  But people who install software from
releases are already familiar with the big three, and there's no
reason to do things gratuitously differently from the way everyone
else does them.</p><p>Although the dots in release numbers are not decimal points,
they do indicate place-value significance.  All "0.X.Y" releases
precede "1.0" (which is equivalent to "1.0.0", of course).  "3.14.158"
immediately precedes "3.14.159", and non-immediately precedes
"3.14.160" as well as "3.15.anything", and so.</p><p>A consistent release numbering policy enables a user to look at
two release numbers for the same piece of software and tell, just from
the numbers, the important differences between those two releases.  In
a typical three-component system, the first component is
the <em class="firstterm">major number</em>, the second is
the <em class="firstterm">minor number</em>, and the third is the
<em class="firstterm">micro number</em>.  For example, release
"2.10.17" is the seventeenth micro release in the tenth minor release
line within the second major release series.  The words "line" and
"series" are used informally here, but they mean what one would
expect.  A major series is simply all the releases that share the same
major number, and a minor series (or minor line) consists of all the releases
that share the same minor <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> major number.  That
is, "2.4.0" and "3.4.1" are not in the same minor series,
even though they both have "4" for their minor number; on the other
hand, "2.4.0" and "2.4.2" are in the same minor line, though they are
not adjacent if "2.4.1" was released between them.</p><p>The meanings of these numbers are exactly what you'd expect: an
increment of the major number indicates that major changes happened;
an increment of the minor number indicates minor changes; and an
increment of the micro number indicates really trivial changes.  Some
projects add a fourth component, usually called
the <em class="firstterm">patch number</em>, for especially
fine-grained control over the differences between their releases
(confusingly, other projects use "patch" as a synonym for "micro" in a
three-component system).  There are also projects that use the last
component as a <em class="firstterm">build number</em>, incremented
every time the software is built and representing no change other than
that build.  This helps the project link every bug report with a
specific build, and is probably most useful when binary packages are
the default method of distribution.</p><p>Although there are many different conventions for how many
components to use, and what the components mean, the differences tend
to be minor&#8212;you get a little leeway, but not a lot.  The next
two sections discuss some of the most widely used conventions.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Simple Strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release-number-simple-strategy"></a>The Simple Strategy</h3></div></div></div><p>Most projects have rules about what kinds of changes are allowed
into a release if one is only incrementing the micro number, different
rules for the minor number, and still different ones for the major
number.  There is no set standard for these rules yet, but here I will
describe a policy that has been used successfully by multiple
projects.  You may want to just adopt this policy in your own
project, but even if you don't, it's still a good example of the kind
of information release numbers should convey.  This policy is adapted
from the numbering system used by the APR project, see

            sets.</p></li></ol></div><p>What <em class="firstterm">backward-compatible</em>
and <em class="firstterm">forward-compatible</em> mean, exactly, depends on
what your software does, but in context they are usually not open to
much interpretation.  For example, if your project is a client/server
application, then "backward-compatible" means that upgrading the
server to 2.6.0 should not cause any existing 2.5.4 clients to lose
functionality or behave differently than they did before (except for
bugs that were fixed, of course).  On the other hand, upgrading one of
those clients to 2.6.0, along with the server, might
make <span class="emphasis"><em>new</em></span> functionality available for that client,
functionality that 2.5.4 clients don't know how to take advantage of.
If that happens, then the upgrade is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span>
"forward-compatible": clearly you can't now downgrade that client
back to 2.5.4 and keep all the functionality it had at 2.6.0, since
some of that functionality was new in 2.6.0.</p><p>This is why micro releases are essentially for bug fixes only.
They must remain compatible in both directions: if you upgrade from
2.5.3 to 2.5.4, then change your mind and downgrade back to 2.5.3, no
functionality should be lost.  Of course, the bugs fixed in 2.5.4
would reappear after the downgrade, but you wouldn't lose any
features, except insofar as the restored bugs prevent the use of some
existing features.</p><p>Client/server protocols are just one of many possible
compatibility domains.  Another is data formats: does the software
write data to permanent storage?  If so, the formats it reads and
writes need to follow the compatibility guidelines promised by the
release number policy.  Version 2.6.0 needs to be able to read the
files written by 2.5.4, but may silently upgrade the format to
something that 2.5.4 cannot read, because the ability to downgrade is
not required across a minor number boundary.  If your project
distributes code libraries for other programs to use, then APIs are a
compatibility domain too: you must make sure that source and binary
compatibility rules are spelled out in such a way that the informed
user need never wonder whether or not it's safe to upgrade in place.
She will be able to look at the numbers and know instantly.</p><p>In this system, you don't get a chance for a fresh start until
you increment the major number.  This can often be a real
inconvenience: there may be features you wish to add, or protocols
that you wish to redesign, that simply cannot be done while
maintaining compatibility.  There's no magic solution to this, except
to try to design things in an extensible way in the first place (a
topic easily worth its own book, and certainly outside the scope of
this one).  But publishing a release compatibility policy, and
adhering to it, is an inescapable part of distributing software.  One
nasty surprise can alienate a lot of users.  The policy just described
is good partly because it's already quite widespread, but also because
it's easy to explain and to remember, even for those not already familiar
with it.</p><p>It is generally understood that these rules do not apply to
pre-1.0 releases (although your release policy should probably state
so explicitly, just to be clear).  A project that is still in initial
development can release 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and so on in sequence, until
it's ready for 1.0, and the differences between those releases can be
arbitrarily large.  Micro numbers in pre-1.0 releases are optional.
Depending on the nature of your project and the differences between
the releases, you might find it useful to have 0.1.0, 0.1.1, etc., or
you might not.  Conventions for pre-1.0 release numbers are fairly
loose, mainly because people understand that strong compatibility
constraints would hamper early development too much, and because early
adopters tend to be forgiving anyway.</p><p>Remember that all these injunctions only apply to this
particular three-component system.  Your project could easily come up
with a different three-component system, or even decide it doesn't
need such fine granularity and use a two-component system instead.
The important thing is to decide early, publish exactly what the
components mean, and stick to it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The Even/Odd Strategy"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release-number-even-odd-strategy"></a>The Even/Odd Strategy</h3></div></div></div><p>Some projects use the parity of the minor number component to
indicate the stability of the software: even means stable, odd means
unstable.  This applies only to the minor number, not the major and
micro numbers.  Increments in the micro number still indicate bug
fixes (no new features), and increments in the major number still
indicate big changes, new feature sets, etc.</p><p>The advantage of the even/odd system, which has been used by the
Linux kernel project among others, is that it offers a way to release
new functionality for testing without subjecting production users to
potentially unstable code.  People can see from the numbers that
"2.4.21" is okay to install on their live web server, but that "2.5.1"
should probably stay confined to home workstation experiments.  The
development team handles the bug reports that come in from the
unstable (odd-minor-numbered) series, and when things start to settle
down after some number of micro releases in that series, they
increment the minor number (thus making it even), reset the micro
number back to "0", and release a presumably stable package.</p><p>This system preserves, or at least, does not conflict with, the
compatibility guidelines given earlier.  It simply overloads the minor
number with some extra information.  This forces the minor number to
be incremented about twice as often as would otherwise be necessary,
but there's no great harm in that.  The even/odd system is probably
best for projects that have very long release cycles, and which by
their nature have a high proportion of conservative users who value
stability above new features.  It is not the only way to get new
functionality tested in the wild, however.
<a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">&#8222;Stabilizing a Release&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span> describes another, perhaps more common,
method of releasing potentially unstable code to the public, marked so
that people have an idea of the risk/benefit trade-offs immediately on
seeing the release's name.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Release Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="release-branches"></a>Release Branches</h2></div></div></div><p>From a developer's point of view, a free software project is in
a state of continuous release.  Developers usually run the latest
available code at all times, because they want to spot bugs, and
because they follow the project closely enough to be able to stay away
from currently unstable areas of the feature space.  They often update
their copy of the software every day, sometimes more than once a day,
and when they check in a change, they can reasonably expect that every
other developer will have it within 24 hours.</p><p>How, then, should the project make a formal release?  Should it
simply take a snapshot of the tree at a moment in time, package it up,
and hand it to the world as, say, version "3.5.0"?  Common sense says
no.  First, there may be no moment in time when the entire development
tree is clean and ready for release.  Newly-started features could be
lying around in various states of completion.  Someone might have
checked in a major change to fix a bug, but the change could be
controversial and under debate at the moment the snapshot is taken.
If so, it wouldn't work to simply delay the snapshot until the debate
ends, because another, unrelated debate could start in the meantime,
and then you'd have wait for <span class="emphasis"><em>that</em></span> one to end too.
This process is not guaranteed to halt.</p><p>In any case, using full-tree snapshots for releases would
interfere with ongoing development work, even if the tree could be put
into a releasable state.  Say this snapshot is going to be "3.5.0";
presumably, the next snapshot would be "3.5.1", and would contain
mostly fixes for bugs found in the 3.5.0 release.  But if both are
snapshots from the same tree, what are the developers supposed to do
in the time between the two releases?  They can't be adding new
features; the compatibility guidelines prevent that.  But not everyone
will be enthusiastic about fixing bugs in the 3.5.0 code.  Some people
may have new features they're trying to complete, and will become
irate if they are forced to choose between sitting idle and working on
things they're not interested in, just because the project's release
processes demand that the development tree remain unnaturally
quiescent.</p><p>The solution to these problems is to always use
a <em class="firstterm">release branch</em>.  A release branch is just a
branch in the version control system (see
<a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-branch"><em class="firstterm">ga&#322;&#261;&#378;</em> (ang.
         <em class="firstterm">branch</em>)</a>), on which the code
destined for this release can be isolated from mainline development.
The concept of release branches is certainly not original to free
software; many commercial development organizations use them too.
However, in commercial environments, release branches are sometimes
considered a luxury&#8212;a kind of formal "best practice" that can,
in the heat of a major deadline, be dispensed with while everyone on
the team scrambles to stabilize the main tree.</p><p>Release branches are pretty much required in open source
projects, however.  I have seen projects do releases without them, but
it has always resulted in some developers sitting idle while
others&#8212;usually a minority&#8212;work on getting the release out
the door.  The result is usually bad in several ways.  First, overall
development momentum is slowed.  Second, the release is of poorer
quality than it needed to be, because there were only a few people
working on it, and they were hurrying to finish so everyone else could
get back to work.  Third, it divides the development team
psychologically, by setting up a situation in which different types of
work interfere with each other unnecessarily.  The developers sitting
idle would probably be happy to contribute <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span>
of their attention to a release branch, as long as that were a choice
they could make according to their own schedules and interests.  But
without the branch, their choice becomes "Do I participate in the
project today or not?"  instead of "Do I work on the release today, or
work on that new feature I've been developing in the mainline
code?"</p><div class="sect2" title="Mechanics of Release Branches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release-branch-mechanics"></a>Mechanics of Release Branches</h3></div></div></div><p>The exact mechanics of creating a release branch depend on your
version control system, of course, but the general concepts are the
same in most systems.  A branch usually sprouts from another branch or
from the trunk.  Traditionally, the trunk is where mainline
development goes on, unfettered by release constraints.  The first
release branch, the one leading to the "1.0" release, sprouts off the
trunk.  In CVS, the branch command would be something like this</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd trunk-working-copy
$ cvs tag -b RELEASE_1_0_X
</pre><p>or in Subversion, like this:</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://.../repos/trunk http://.../repos/branches/1.0.x
</pre><p>(All these examples assume a three-component release numbering
system.  While I can't show the exact commands for every version
control system, I'll give examples in CVS and Subversion and hope that
the corresponding commands in other systems can be deduced from those
two.)</p><p>Notice that we created branch "1.0.x" (with a literal "x")
instead of "1.0.0".  This is because the same minor line&#8212;i.e.,
the same branch&#8212;will be used for all the micro releases in that
line.  The actual process of stabilizing the branch for release is
covered in
<a class="xref" href="#stabilizing-a-release" title="Stabilizing a Release">&#8222;Stabilizing a Release&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>.  Here we are
concerned just with the interaction between the version control system
and the release process.  When the release branch is stabilized and
ready, it is time to tag a snapshot from the branch:</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd RELEASE_1_0_X-working-copy
$ cvs tag RELEASE_1_0_0
</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://.../repos/branches/1.0.x http://.../repos/tags/1.0.0
</pre><p>That tag now represents the exact state of the project's source
tree in the 1.0.0 release (this is useful in case anyone ever needs to
get an old version after the packaged distributions and binaries have
been taken down).  The next micro release in the same line is likewise
prepared on the 1.0.x branch, and when it is ready, a tag is made for
1.0.1.  Lather, rinse, repeat for 1.0.2, and so on.  When it's time to
start thinking about a 1.1.x release, make a new branch from
trunk:</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd trunk-working-copy
$ cvs tag -b RELEASE_1_1_X
</pre><p>or</p><pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://.../repos/trunk http://.../repos/branches/1.1.x
</pre><p>Maintenance can continue in parallel along both 1.0.x and 1.1.x,
and releases can be made independently from both lines.  In fact, it
is not unusual to publish near-simultaneous releases from two
different lines.  The older series is recommended for more
conservative site administrators, who may not want to make the big
jump to (say) 1.1 without careful preparation.  Meanwhile, more
adventurous people usually take the most recent release on the highest
line, to make sure they're getting the latest features, even at the
risk of greater instability.</p></div><p>This is not the only release branch strategy, of course.  In
some circumstances it may not even be the best, though it's worked out
pretty well for projects I've been involved in.  Use any strategy that
seems to work, but remember the main points: the purpose of a release
branch is to isolate release work from the fluctuations of daily
development, and to give the project a physical entity around which to
organize its release process.  That process is described in detail in
the next section.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Stabilizing a Release"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="stabilizing-a-release"></a>Stabilizing a Release</h2></div></div></div><p><em class="firstterm">Stabilization</em> is the process of getting a
release branch into a releasable state; that is, of deciding which
changes will be in the release, which will not, and shaping the branch
content accordingly.</p><p>There's a lot of potential grief contained in that word,
"deciding".  The last-minute feature rush is a familiar phenomenon in
collaborative software projects: as soon as developers see that a
release is about to happen, they scramble to finish their current
changes, in order not to miss the boat.  This, of course, is the exact
opposite of what you want at release time.  It would be much better
for people to work on features at a comfortable pace, and not worry
too much about whether their changes make it into this release or the
next one.  The more changes one tries to cram into a release at the
last minute, the more the code is destabilized, and (usually) the more
new bugs are created.</p><p>Most software engineers agree in theory on rough criteria for
what changes should be allowed into a release line during its
stabilization period.  Obviously, fixes for severe bugs can go in,
especially for bugs without workarounds.  Documentation updates are
fine, as are fixes to error messages (except when they are considered
part of the interface and must remain stable).  Many projects also
allow certain kinds of low-risk or non-core changes to go in during
stabilization, and may have formal guidelines for measuring risk.  But
no amount of formalization can obviate the need for human judgement.
There will always be cases where the project simply has to make a
decision about whether a given change can go into a release.  The
danger is that since each person wants to see their own favorite
changes admitted into the release, then there will be plenty of people
motivated to allow changes, and not enough people motivated to bar
them.</p><p>Thus, the process of stabilizing a release is mostly about
creating mechanisms for saying "no".  The trick for open source
projects, in particular, is to come up with ways of saying "no" that
won't result in too many hurt feelings or disappointed developers, and
also won't prevent deserving changes from getting into the release.
There are many different ways to do this.  It's pretty easy to design
systems that satisfy these criteria, once the team has focused on them
as the important criteria.  Here I'll briefly describe two of the most
popular systems, at the extreme ends of the spectrum, but don't let
that discourage your project from being creative.  Plenty of other
arrangements are possible; these are just two that I've seen work in
practice.</p><div class="sect2" title="Dictatorship by Release Owner"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release-owner"></a>Dictatorship by Release Owner</h3></div></div></div><p>The group agrees to let one person be the <em class="firstterm">release
owner</em>.  This person has final say over what changes make
it into the release.  Of course, it is normal and expected for there
to be discussions and arguments, but in the end the group must grant
the release owner sufficient authority to make final decisions.  For
this system to work, it is necessary to choose someone with the
technical competence to understand all the changes, and the social
standing and people skills to navigate the discussions leading up to
the release without causing too many hurt feelings.</p><p>A common pattern is for the release owner to say "I don't think
there's anything wrong with this change, but we haven't had enough
time to test it yet, so it shouldn't go into this release."  It helps
a lot if the release owner has broad technical knowledge of the
project, and can give reasons why the change could be potentially
destabilizing (for example, its interactions with other parts of the
software, or portability concerns).  People will sometimes ask such
decisions to be justified, or will argue that a change is not as risky
as it looks.  These conversations need not be confrontational, as long
as the release owner is able to consider all the arguments objectively
and not reflexively dig in his heels.</p><p>Note that the release owner need not be the same person as the
project leader (in cases where there is a project leader at all; see
<a class="xref" href="#benevolent-dictator" title="Benevolent Dictators">&#8222;Benevolent Dictators&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Rozdzia&#322; 4, <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>).  In fact,
sometimes it's
good to make sure they're <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the same person.
The skills that make a good development leader are not necessarily the
same as those that make a good release owner.  In something as
important as the release process, it may be wise to have someone
provide a counterbalance to the project leader's judgement.</p><p>Contrast the release owner role with the less dictatorial role
described in
<a class="xref" href="#release-manager" title="Release manager">&#8222;Release manager&#8221;</a><span> later
in this chapter</span>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Change Voting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release-voting"></a>Change Voting</h3></div></div></div><p>At the opposite extreme from dictatorship by release owner,
developers can simply vote on which changes to include in the release.
However, since the most important function of release stabilization is
to <span class="emphasis"><em>exclude</em></span> changes, it's important to design the
voting system in such a way that getting a change into the release
involves positive action by multiple developers.  Including a change
should need more than just a simple majority (see <a class="xref" href="#electorate" title="Who Votes?">&#8222;Who Votes?&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Rozdzia&#322; 4, <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>).  Otherwise,
one vote for and none against a given change would suffice to get it
into the release, and an
unfortunate dynamic would be set up whereby each developer would vote
for her own changes, yet would be reluctant to vote against others'
changes, for fear of possible retaliation.  To avoid this, the system
should be arranged such that subgroups of developers must act in
cooperation to get any change into the release.  This not only means
that more people review each change, it also makes any individual
developer less hesitant to vote against a change, because she knows
that no particular one among those who voted for it would take her
vote against as a personal affront.  The greater the number of people
involved, the more the discussion becomes about the change and less
about the individuals.</p><p>The system we use in the Subversion project seems to have struck
a good balance, so I'll recommend it here.  In order for a change to
be applied to the release branch, at least three developers must vote
in favor of it, and none against.  A single "no" vote is enough to
stop the change from being included; that is, a "no" vote in a release
context is equivalent to a veto (see <a class="xref" href="#veto" title="Vetoes">&#8222;Vetoes&#8221;</a>).
Naturally, any such vote must be accompanied by a justification, and
in theory the veto could be overridden if enough people feel it is
unreasonable and force a special vote over it.  In practice, this has
never happened, and I don't expect that it ever will.  People are
conservative around releases anyway, and when someone feels strongly
enough to veto the inclusion of a change, there's usually a good
reason for it.</p><p>Because the release procedure is deliberately biased toward
conservatism, the justifications offered for vetoes are sometimes
procedural rather than technical.  For example, a person may feel that
a change is well-written and unlikely to cause any new bugs, but vote
against its inclusion in a micro release simply because it's too
big&#8212;perhaps it adds a new feature, or in some subtle way fails
to fully follow the compatibility guidelines.  I've occasionally even
seen developers veto something because they simply had a gut feeling
that the change needed more testing, even though they couldn't spot
any bugs in it by inspection.  People grumbled a little bit, but the
vetoes stood and the change was not included in the release (I don't
remember if any bugs were found in later testing or not,
though).</p><div class="sect3" title="Managing collaborative release stabilization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="release-stabilization-collaboration"></a>Managing collaborative release stabilization</h4></div></div></div><p>If your project chooses a change voting system, it is imperative
that the physical mechanics of setting up ballots and casting votes be
as convenient as possible.  Although there is plenty of open source
electronic voting software available, in practice the easiest thing to
do is just to set up a text file in the release branch,
called <code class="filename">STATUS</code> or <code class="filename">VOTES</code> or
something like that.  This file lists each proposed change&#8212;any
developer can propose a change for inclusion&#8212;along with all the
votes for and against it, plus any notes or comments.  (Proposing a
change doesn't necessarily mean voting for it, by the way, although
the two often go together.)  An entry in such a file might look like
this:</p><pre class="screen">
* r2401 (issue #49)
  Prevent client/server handshake from happening twice.
  Justification:
    Avoids extra network turnaround; small change and easy to review.
  Notes:
    This was discussed in http://.../mailing-lists/message-7777.html
    and other messages in that thread.
  Votes:
    +1: jsmith, kimf
    -1: tmartin (breaks compatibility with some pre-1.0 servers;
                 admittedly, those servers are buggy, but why be
                 incompatible if we don't have to?)
</pre><p>In this case, the change acquired two positive votes, but was
vetoed by tmartin, who gave the reason for the veto in a parenthetical
note.  The exact format of the entry doesn't matter; whatever your
project settles on is fine&#8212;perhaps tmartin's explanation for the
veto should go up in the "Notes:" section, or perhaps the change
description should get a "Description:" header to match the other
sections.  The important thing is that all the information needed to
evaluate the change be reachable, and that the mechanism for casting
votes be as lightweight as possible.  The proposed change is referred
to by its revision number in the repository (in this case a single
revision, r2401, although a proposed change could just as easily
consist of multiple revisions).  The revision is assumed to refer to a
change made on the trunk; if the change were already on the release
branch, there would be no need to vote on it.  If your version control
system doesn't have an obvious syntax for referring to individual
changes, then the project should make one up.  For voting to be
practical, each change under consideration must be unambiguously
identifiable.</p><p>Those proposing or voting for a change are responsible for
making sure it applies cleanly to the release branch, that is, applies
without conflicts (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-conflict"><em class="firstterm">konflikt</em> (ang.
         <em class="firstterm">conflict</em>)</a>).
If there are conflicts, then the entry should either point to an
adjusted patch that does apply cleanly, or to a temporary branch that
holds an adjusted version of the change, for example:</p><pre class="screen">

<code class="filename">STATUS</code> file for the Subversion 1.1.4 release

handles on the change, even though there is also a branch with a
conflict-adjusted version of the change (the branch also combines the
three trunk revisions into one, r13517, to make it easier to merge the
change into the release, should it get approval).  The original
revisions are provided because they're still the easiest entity to
review, since they have the original log messages.  The temporary
branch wouldn't have those log messages; in order to avoid duplication
of information (see

<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>), the
branch's log message for r13517 should simply say "Adjust r13222,
r13223, and r13232 for backport to 1.1.x branch."  All other
information about the changes can be chased down at their original
revisions.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Release manager"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="release-manager"></a>Release manager</h4></div></div></div><p>The actual process of merging (see

release branch can be performed by any developer.  There does not need
to be one person whose job it is to merge changes; if there are a lot
of changes, it can be better to spread the burden around.</p><p>However, although both voting and merging happen in a
decentralized fashion, in practice there are usually one or two people
driving the release process.  This role is sometimes formally blessed
as <em class="firstterm">release manager</em>, but it is quite different
from a release owner (see
<a class="xref" href="#release-owner" title="Dictatorship by Release Owner">&#8222;Dictatorship by Release Owner&#8221;</a><span> earlier

final say over the changes.  Release managers keep track of how many
changes are currently under consideration, how many have been
approved, how many seem likely to be approved, etc.  If they sense
that important changes are not getting enough attention, and might be
left out of the release for lack of votes, they will gently nag other
developers to review and vote.  When a batch of changes are approved,
these people will often take it upon themselves to merge them into the
release branch; it's fine if others leave that task to them, as
long as everyone understands that they are not obligated to do all the
work unless they have explicitly committed to it.  When the time comes
to put the release out the door (see

runs in source form (i.e., can be interpreted, like Perl, Python, PHP,
etc.) or needs to be compiled first (like C, C++, Java, etc.).  With
compiled software, most users will probably not compile the sources
themselves, but will instead install from pre-built binary packages
(see <a class="xref" href="#binary-packages" title="Binary Packages">&#8222;Binary Packages&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>).  However, those binary
packages are still derived from a master source distribution.  The
point of the source package is to unambiguously define the release.
When the project distributes "Scanley 2.5.0", what it means,
specifically, is "The tree of source code files that, when compiled
(if necessary) and installed, produces Scanley 2.5.0."</p><p>There is a fairly strict standard for how source releases
should look.  One will occasionally see deviations from this standard,
but they are the exception, not the rule.  Unless there is a compelling
reason to do otherwise, your project should follow this standard
too.</p><div class="sect2" title="Format"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="packaging-format"></a>Format</h3></div></div></div><p>The source code should be shipped in the standard formats for
transporting directory trees.  For Unix and Unix-like operating
systems, the convention is to use TAR format, compressed
by <span class="command"><strong>compress</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>gzip</strong></span>,
<span class="command"><strong>bzip</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>bzip2</strong></span>.  For MS Windows,
the standard method for distributing directory trees
is <em class="firstterm">zip</em> format, which happens to do compression
as well, so there is no need to compress the archive after creating
it.</p><div class="sidebar" title="TAR Files"><a name="packaging-tar"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>TAR Files</b></p></div></div></div><p><em class="firstterm">TAR</em> stands for "Tape ARchive",
   because tar format represents a directory tree as a linear data
   stream, which makes it ideal for saving directory trees to tape.
   The same property also makes it the standard for distributing
   directory trees as a single file.  Producing compressed tar files
   (or <em class="firstterm">tarballs</em>) is pretty easy.  On some
   systems, the <span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> command can produce a
   compressed archive itself; on others, a separate compression
   program is used.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Name and Layout"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="packaging-name-and-layout"></a>Name and Layout</h3></div></div></div><p>The name of the package should consist of the software's name
plus the release number, plus the format suffixes appropriate for the
archive type.  For example, Scanley 2.5.0, packaged for Unix using GNU
Zip (gzip) compression, would look like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</p></div></div><p>or for Windows using zip compression:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.zip</p></div></div><p>Either of these archives, when unpacked, should create a single
new directory tree named <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code> in the
current directory.  Underneath the new directory, the source code
should be arranged in a layout ready for compilation (if compilation
is needed) and installation.  In the top level of new directory tree,
there should be a plain text <code class="filename">README</code> file
explaining what the software does and what release this is, and giving
pointers to other resources, such as the project's web site, other
files of interest, etc.  Among those other files should be an
<code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file, sibling to
the <code class="filename">README</code> file, giving instructions on how to build
and install the software for all the operating systems it supports.
As mentioned in
<a class="xref" href="#license-quickstart-applying" title="How to Apply a License to Your Software">&#8222;How to Apply a License to Your Software&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Rozdzia&#322; 2. Zaczynamy">Rozdzia&#322; 2, <i>Zaczynamy</i></a></span>, there should also
be a <code class="filename">COPYING</code> or <code class="filename">LICENSE</code>
file, giving the software's terms of distribution.</p><p>There should also be a <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file
(sometimes called <code class="filename">NEWS</code>), explaining what's new in
this release.  The <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file accumulates
changelists for all releases, in reverse chronological order, so that
the list for this release appears at the top of the file.  Completing
that list is usually the last thing done on a stabilizing release
branch; some projects write the list piecemeal as they're developing,
others prefer to save it all up for the end and have one person write
it, getting information by combing the version control logs.  The list
looks something like this:</p><pre class="screen">
Version 2.5.0
(20 December 2004, from /branches/2.5.x)
http://svn.scanley.org/repos/svn/tags/2.5.0/

 New features, enhancements:
    * Added regular expression queries (issue #53)
    * Added support for UTF-8 and UTF-16 documents
    * Documentation translated into Polish, Russian, Malagasy
    * ...

 Bugfixes:
    * fixed reindexing bug (issue #945)
    * fixed some query bugs (issues #815, #1007, #1008)
    * ...
</pre><p>The list can be as long as necessary, but don't bother to
include every little bugfix and feature enhancement.  Its purpose is
simply to give users an overview of what they would gain by upgrading
to the new release.  In fact, the changelist is customarily included
in the announcement email (see
<a class="xref" href="#testing-and-releasing" title="Testing and Releasing">&#8222;Testing and Releasing&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so write it with that
audience in mind.</p><div class="sidebar" title="CHANGES Versus ChangeLog"><a name="changelog"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>CHANGES Versus ChangeLog</b></p></div></div></div><p>Traditionally, a file named <em class="firstterm">ChangeLog</em>
   lists every change ever made to a project&#8212;that is, every
   revision committed to the version control system.  There are
   various formats for ChangeLog files; the details of the formats
   aren't important here, as they all contain the same information:
   the date of the change, its author, and a brief summary (or just
   the log message for that change).</p><p>A <code class="filename">CHANGES</code> file is different.  It too is
   a list of changes, but only the ones thought important for a
   certain audience to see, and often with metadata like the exact
   date and author stripped off.  To avoid confusion, don't use the
   terms interchangeably.  Some projects use "NEWS" instead of
   "CHANGES"; although this avoids the potential for confusion with
   "ChangeLog", it is a bit of a misnomer, since the CHANGES file
   retains change information for all releases, and thus has a lot of
   old news in addition to the new news at the top.</p><p>ChangeLog files may be slowly disappearing anyway.  They were
   helpful in the days when CVS was the only choice of version control
   system, because change data was not easy to extract from CVS.
   However, with more recent version control systems, the data that
   used to be kept in the ChangeLog can be requested from the version
   control repository at any time, making it pointless for the project
   to keep a static file containing that data&#8212;in fact, worse
   than pointless, since the ChangeLog would merely duplicate the log
   messages already stored in the repository.</p></div><p>The actual layout of the source code inside the tree should be
the same as, or as similar as possible to, the source code layout one
would get by checking out the project directly from its version
control repository.  Usually there are a few differences, for example
because the package contains some generated files needed for
configuration and compilation (see
<a class="xref" href="#packaging-build-install" title="Compilation and Installation">&#8222;Compilation and Installation&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), or because it includes
third-party software that is not maintained by the project, but that
is required and that users are not likely to already have.  But even
if the distributed tree corresponds exactly to some development tree
in the version control repository, the distribution itself should not
be a working copy (see <a class="xref" href="#vc-vocabulary-working-copy"><em class="firstterm">kopia robocza</em> (<em class="firstterm">ang. working
             copy</em>)</a>).
The release is supposed to represent a static reference point&#8212;a
particular, unchangeable configuration of source files.  If it were a
working copy, the danger would be that the user might update it, and
afterward think that he still has the release when in fact he has
something different.</p><p>Remember that the package is the same regardless of the
packaging.  The release&#8212;that is, the precise entity referred to
when someone says "Scanley 2.5.0"&#8212;is the tree created by
unpacking a zip file or tarball.  So the project might offer all of
these for download:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.5.0.tar.bz2<br>
scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz<br>
scanley-2.5.0.zip</p></div></div><p>...but the source tree created by unpacking them must be the
same.  That source tree is the distribution; the form in which it is
downloaded is merely a matter of convenience.  Certain trivial
differences between source packages are allowable: for example, in the
Windows package, text files should have lines ending with CRLF
(Carriage Return and Line Feed), while Unix packages should use just
LF.  The trees may be arranged slightly differently between source
packages destined for different operating systems, too, if those
operating systems require different sorts of layouts for compilation.
However, these are all basically trivial transformations.  The basic
source files should be the same across all the packagings of a given
release.</p><div class="sect3" title="To capitalize or not to capitalize"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="release-capitalization"></a>To capitalize or not to capitalize</h4></div></div></div><p>When referring to a project by name, people generally capitalize
it as a proper noun, and capitalize acronyms if there are any:
"MySQL 5.0", "Scanley 2.5.0", etc.  Whether this
capitalization is reproduced in the package name is up to the project.
Either <code class="filename">Scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> or
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code> would be fine, for example
(I personally prefer the latter, because I don't like to make people
hit the shift key, but plenty of projects ship capitalized packages).
The important thing is that the directory created by unpacking the
tarball use the same capitalization.  There should be no surprises:
the user must be able to predict with perfect accuracy the name of the
directory that will be created when she unpacks a distribution.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Pre-releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="release-prereleases"></a>Pre-releases</h4></div></div></div><p>When shipping a pre-release or candidate release, the qualifier
is truly a part of the release number, so include it in the name of
the package's name.  For example, the ordered sequence of alpha and
beta releases given earlier in
<a class="xref" href="#release-number-components" title="Release Number Components">&#8222;Release Number Components&#8221;</a> would result in
package names like this:</p><div class="informalexample"><div class="literallayout"><p>scanley-2.3.0-alpha1.tar.gz<br>
scanley-2.3.0-alpha2.tar.gz<br>
scanley-2.3.0-beta1.tar.gz<br>
scanley-2.3.0-beta2.tar.gz<br>
scanley-2.3.0-beta3.tar.gz<br>
scanley-2.3.0.tar.gz</p></div></div><p>The first would unpack into a directory
named <code class="filename">scanley-2.3.0-alpha1</code>, the second into
<code class="filename">scanley-2.3.0-alpha2</code>, and so on.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Compilation and Installation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="packaging-build-install"></a>Compilation and Installation</h3></div></div></div><p>For software requiring compilation or installation from source,
there are usually standard procedures that experienced users expect to
be able to follow.  For example, for programs written in C, C++, or
certain other compiled languages, the standard under Unix-like systems
is for the user to type:</p><pre class="screen">
   $ ./configure
   $ make
   # make install
</pre><p>The first command autodetects as much about the environment as
it can and prepares for the build process, the second command builds
the software in place (but does not install it), and the last command
installs it on the system.  The first two commands are done as a
regular user, the third as root.  For more details about setting up
this system, see the excellent <em class="citetitle">GNU Autoconf, Automake, and
Libtool</em> book by Vaughan, Elliston, Tromey, and Taylor.  It
is published as treeware by New Riders, and its content is also freely
available online at
<a class="ulink" href="http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/" target="_top">http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/</a>.</p><p>This is not the only standard, though it is one of the most
widespread.  The Ant (<a class="ulink" href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_top">http://ant.apache.org/</a>) build
system is gaining popularity, especially with projects written in
Java, and it has its own standard procedures for building and
installing.  Also, certain programming languages, such as Perl and
Python, recommend that the same method be used for most programs
written in that language (for example, Perl modules use the
command <span class="command"><strong>perl Makefile.PL</strong></span>).  If it's not
obvious to you what the applicable standards are for your project, ask
an experienced developer; you can safely assume
that <span class="emphasis"><em>some</em></span> standard applies, even if you don't
know what it is at first.</p><p>Whatever the appropriate standards for you project are, don't
deviate from them unless you absolutely must.  Standard installation
procedures are practically spinal reflexes for a lot of system
administrators now.  If they see familiar invocations documented in
your project's <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file, that instantly
raises their faith that your project is generally aware of
conventions, and that it is likely to have gotten other things right
as well.  Also, as discussed in
<a class="xref" href="#downloads" title="Downloads">&#8222;Downloads&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#getting-started" title="Rozdzia&#322; 2. Zaczynamy">Rozdzia&#322; 2, <i>Zaczynamy</i></a></span>, having a standard
build procedure pleases potential developers.</p><p>On Windows, the standards for building and installing are a bit
less settled.  For projects requiring compilation, the general
convention seems to be to ship a tree that can fit into the
workspace/project model of the standard Microsoft development
environments (Developer Studio, Visual Studio, VS.NET, MSVC++, etc.).
Depending on the nature of your software, it may be possible to offer
a Unix-like build option on Windows via the Cygwin
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_top">http://www.cygwin.com/</a>) environment.  And of course,
if you're using a language or programming framework that comes with
its own build and install conventions&#8212;e.g., Perl or
Python&#8212;you should simply use whatever the standard method is for
that framework, whether on Windows, Unix, Mac OS X, or any other
operating system.</p><p>Be willing to put in a lot of extra effort in order to make your
project conform to the relevant build or installation standards.
Building and installing is an entry point: it's okay for things to get
harder after that, if they absolutely must, but it would be a shame
for the user's or developer's very first interaction with the software
to require unexpected steps.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Binary Packages"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="binary-packages"></a>Binary Packages</h3></div></div></div><p>Although the formal release is a source code package, most users
will install from binary packages, either provided by their operating
system's software distribution mechanism, or obtained manually from
the project web site or from some third party.  Here "binary" doesn't
necessarily mean "compiled"; it just means any pre-configured form of
the package that allows a user to install it on his computer without
going through the usual source-based build and install procedures.  On
RedHat GNU/Linux, it is the RPM system; on Debian GNU/Linux, it is the
APT (<code class="filename">.deb</code>) system; on MS Windows, it's usually
<code class="literal">.MSI</code> files or self-installing
<code class="literal">.exe</code> files.</p><p>Whether these binary packages are assembled by people closely
associated with the project, or by distant third parties, users are
going to <span class="emphasis"><em>treat</em></span> them as equivalent to the
project's official releases, and will file issues in the project's bug
tracker based on the behavior of the binary packages.  Therefore, it
is in the project's interest to provide packagers with clear
guidelines, and work closely with them to see to it that what they
produce represents the software fairly and accurately.</p><p>The main thing packagers need to know is that they should always
base their binary packages on an official source release.  Sometimes
packagers are tempted to pull a later incarnation of the code from the
repository, or include selected changes that were committed after the
release was made, in order to provide users with certain bug fixes or
other improvements.  The packager thinks he is doing his users a favor
by giving them the more recent code, but actually this practice can
cause a great deal of confusion.  Projects are prepared to receive
reports of bugs found in released versions, and bugs found in recent
trunk and major branch code (that is, found by people who deliberately
run bleeding edge code).  When a bug report comes in from these
sources, the responder will often be able to confirm that the bug is
known to be present in that snapshot, and perhaps that it has since
been fixed and that the user should upgrade or wait for the
next release.  If it is a previously unknown bug, having the precise
release makes it easier to reproduce and easier to categorize in the
tracker.</p><p>Projects are not prepared, however, to receive bug reports based
on unspecified intermediate or hybrid versions.  Such bugs can be hard
to reproduce; also, they may be due to unexpected interactions in
isolated changes pulled in from later development, and thereby cause
misbehaviors that the project's developers should not have to take the
blame for.  I have even seen dismayingly large amounts of time wasted
because a bug was <span class="emphasis"><em>absent</em></span> when it should have been
present: someone was running a slightly patched up version, based on
(but not identical to) an official release, and when the predicted bug
did not happen, everyone had to dig around a lot to figure out
why.</p><p>Still, there will sometimes be circumstances when a packager
insists that modifications to the source release are necessary.
Packagers should be encouraged to bring this up with the project's
developers and describe their plans.  They may get approval, but
failing that, they will at least have notified the project of their
intentions, so the project can watch out for unusual bug reports.  The
developers may respond by putting a disclaimer on the project's web
site, and may ask that the packager do the same thing in the
appropriate place, so that users of that binary package know what they
are getting is not exactly the same as what the project officially
released.  There need be no animosity in such a situation, though
unfortunately there often is.  It's just that packagers have a
slightly different set of goals from developers.  The packagers mainly
want the best out-of-the-box experience for their users.  The
developers want that too, of course, but they also need to ensure that
they know what versions of the software are out there, so they can
receive coherent bug reports and make compatibility guarantees.
Sometimes these goals conflict.  When they do, it's good to keep in
mind that the project has no control over the packagers, and that the
bonds of obligation run both ways.  It's true that the project is
doing the packagers a favor simply by producing the software.  But the
packagers are also doing the project a favor, by taking on a mostly
unglamorous job in order to make the software more widely available,
often by orders of magnitude.  It's fine to disagree with packagers,
but don't flame them; just try to work things out as best you
can.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Testing and Releasing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="testing-and-releasing"></a>Testing and Releasing</h2></div></div></div><p>Once the source tarball is produced from the stabilized release
branch, the public part of the release process begins.  But before the
tarball is made available to the world at large, it should be tested
and approved by some minimum number of developers, usually three or
more.  Approval is not simply a matter of inspecting the release for
obvious flaws; ideally, the developers download the tarball, build and
install it onto a clean system, run the regression test suite (see
<a class="xref" href="#automated-testing" title="Automatyczne testowanie">&#8222;Automatyczne testowanie&#8221;</a>)<span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span>, and do some
manual testing.  Assuming it passes these checks, as well as any other
release checklist criteria the project may have, the developers then
digitally sign the tarball using GnuPG
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnupg.org/" target="_top">http://www.gnupg.org/</a>), PGP
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.pgpi.org/" target="_top">http://www.pgpi.org/</a>), or some other program capable
of producing PGP-compatible signatures.</p><p>In most projects, the developers just use their personal digital
signatures, instead of a shared project key, and as many developers as
want to may sign (i.e., there is a minimum number, but not a maximum).
The more developers sign, the more testing the release undergoes, and
also the greater the likelihood that a security-conscious user can
find a digital trust path from herself to the tarball.</p><p>Once approved, the release (that is, all tarballs, zip files,
and whatever other formats are being distributed) should be placed
into the project's download area, accompanied by the digital
signatures, and by MD5/SHA1 checksums (see <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function</a>).
There are various standards for doing this.  One way is to accompany
each released package with a file giving the corresponding digital
signatures, and another file giving the checksum.  For example, if one
of the released packages is <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz</code>,
place in the same directory a file
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.asc</code> containing the digital
signature for that tarball, another file
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.md5</code> containing its MD5
checksum, and optionally another,
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.tar.gz.sha1</code>, containing the SHA1
checksum.  A different way to provide checking is to collect all the
signatures for all the released packages into a single file,
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0.sigs</code>; the same may be done with the
checksums.</p><p>It doesn't really matter which way you do it.  Just keep to a
simple scheme, describe it clearly, and be consistent from release to
release.  The purpose of all this signing and checksumming is to give
users a way to verify that the copy they receive has not been
maliciously tampered with.  Users are about to run this code on their
computers&#8212;if the code has been tampered with, an attacker could
suddenly have a back door to all their data.  See
<a class="xref" href="#security-releases" title="Security Releases">&#8222;Security Releases&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span> for more about paranoia.</p><div class="sect2" title="Candidate Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="candidate-releases"></a>Candidate Releases</h3></div></div></div><p>For important releases containing many changes, many projects
prefer to put out <em class="firstterm">release candidates</em> first,
e.g., <code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta1</code> before
<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0</code>.  The purpose of a candidate is to
subject the code to wide testing before blessing it as an official
release.  If problems are found, they are fixed on the release branch
and a new candidate release is rolled out
(<code class="filename">scanley-2.5.0-beta2</code>).  The cycle continues until
no unacceptable bugs are left, at which point the last candidate
release becomes the official release&#8212;that is, the only
difference between the last candidate release and the real release
is the removal of the qualifier from the version number.</p><p>In most other respects, a candidate release should be treated
the same as a real release.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>alpha</em></span>,
<span class="emphasis"><em>beta</em></span>, or <span class="emphasis"><em>rc</em></span> qualifier is
enough to warn conservative users to wait until the real release, and
of course the announcement emails for the candidate releases should
point out that their purpose is to solicit feedback.  Other than
that, give candidate releases the same amount of care as regular
releases.  After all, you want people to use the candidates, because
exposure is the best way to uncover bugs, and also because you never
know which candidate release will end up becoming the official
release.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Announcing Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="release-announcement"></a>Announcing Releases</h3></div></div></div><p>Announcing a release is like announcing any other event, and
should use the procedures described in
<a class="xref" href="#publicity" title="Publicity">&#8222;Publicity&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>.  There are a few
specific things to do for releases, though.</p><p>Whenever you give the URL to the downloadable release tarball,
make sure to also give the MD5/SHA1 checksums and pointers to the
digital signatures file.  Since the announcement happens in multiple
forums (mailing list, news page, etc.), this means users can get the
checksums from multiple sources, which gives the most
security-conscious among them extra assurance that the checksums
themselves have not been tampered with.  Giving the link to the
digital signature files multiple times doesn't make those signatures
more secure, but it does reassure people (especially those who don't
follow the project closely) that the project takes security
seriously.</p><p>In the announcement email, and on news pages that contain more
than just a blurb about the release, make sure to include the relevant
portion of the CHANGES file, so people can see why it might be in
their interests to upgrade.  This is as important with candidate
releases as with final releases; the presence of bugfixes and new
features is important in tempting people to try out a candidate
release.</p><p>Finally, don't forget to thank the development team, the
testers, and all the people who took the time to file good bug
reports.  Don't single out anyone by name, though, unless there's
someone who is individually responsible for a huge piece of work,
the value of which is widely recognized by everyone in the
project.  Just be wary of sliding down the slippery slope of credit
inflation (see <a class="xref" href="#credit" title="Uznanie zas&#322;ug">&#8222;Uznanie zas&#322;ug&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8.

parallel.  For example, after 1.0.0 comes out, that line should
continue with micro (bugfix) releases 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc., until the
project explicitly decides to end the line.  Note that merely
releasing 1.1.0 is not sufficient reason to end the 1.0.x line.  For
example, some users make it a policy never to upgrade to the first
release in a new minor or major series&#8212;they let others shake the
bugs out of, say 1.1.0, and wait until 1.1.1.  This isn't necessarily
selfish (remember, they're forgoing the bugfixes and new features
too); it's just that, for whatever reason, they've decided to be very
careful with upgrades.  Accordingly, if the project learns of a major
bug in 1.0.3 right before it's about to release 1.1.0, it would be a
bit severe to just put the bugfix in 1.1.0 and tell all the old 1.0.x
users they should upgrade.  Why not release both 1.1.0 and 1.0.4, so
everyone can be happy?</p><p>After the 1.1.x line is well under way, you can declare 1.0.x to
be at <em class="firstterm">end of life</em>.  This should be announced
officially.  The announcement could stand alone, or it could be
mentioned as part of a 1.1.x release announcement; however you do
it, users need to know that the old line is being phased out, so they
can make upgrade decisions accordingly.</p><p>Some projects set a window of time during which they pledge to
support the previous release line.  In an open source context,
"support" means accepting bug reports against that line, and making
maintenance releases when significant bugs are found.  Other projects
don't give a definite amount of time, but watch incoming bug reports
to gauge how many people are still using the older line.  When the
percentage drops below a certain point, they declare end of life for
the line and stop supporting it.</p><p>For each release, make sure to have a <em class="firstterm">target
version</em> or <em class="firstterm">target milestone</em>
available in the bug tracker, so people filing bugs will be able to do
so against the proper release.  Don't forget to also have a target
called "development" or "latest" for the most recent development
sources, since some people&#8212;not only active developers&#8212;will
often stay ahead of the official releases.</p><div class="sect2" title="Security Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="security-releases"></a>Security Releases</h3></div></div></div><p>Most of the details of handling security bugs were covered in
<a class="xref" href="#security" title="Announcing Security Vulnerabilities">&#8222;Announcing Security Vulnerabilities&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>, but there are some
special details to discuss for doing security releases.</p><p>A <em class="firstterm">security release</em> is a release made
solely to close a security vulnerability.  The code that fixes the bug
cannot be made public until the release is available, which means not
only that the fixes cannot be committed to the repository until the
day of the release, but also that the release cannot be publicly
tested before it goes out the door.  Obviously, the developers can
examine the fix among themselves, and test the release privately, but
widespread real-world testing is not possible.</p><p>Because of this lack of testing, a security release should
always consist of some existing release plus the fixes for the
security bug, with <span class="emphasis"><em>no other changes</em></span>.  This is
because the more changes you ship without testing, the more likely
that one of them will cause a new bug, perhaps even a new security
bug!  This conservatism is also friendly to administrators who may
need to deploy the security fix, but whose upgrade policy prefers that
they not deploy any other changes at the same time.</p><p>Making a security release sometimes involves some minor
deception.  For example, the project may have been working on a 1.1.3
release, with certain bug fixes to 1.1.2 already publicly declared,
when a security report comes in.  Naturally, the developers cannot
talk about the security problem until they make the fix available;
until then, they must continue to talk publicly as though 1.1.3 will
be what it's always been planned to be.  But when 1.1.3 actually
comes out, it will differ from 1.1.2 only in the security fixes, and
all those other fixes will have been deferred to 1.1.4 (which, of
course, will now <span class="emphasis"><em>also</em></span> contain the security
fix, as will all other future releases).</p><p>You could add an extra component to an existing release to
indicate that it contains security changes only.  For example, people
would be able to tell just from the numbers that 1.1.2.1 is a security
release against 1.1.2, and they would know that any release "higher"
than that (e.g., 1.1.3, 1.2.0, etc.) contains the same security fixes.
For those in the know, this system conveys a lot of information.  On
the other hand, for those not following the project closely, it can be
a bit confusing to see a three-component release number most of the
time with an occasional four-component one thrown in seemingly at
random.  Most projects I've looked at choose consistency and simply
use the next regularly scheduled number for security releases, even
when it means shifting other planned releases by one.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Releases and Daily Development"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="releases-and-daily-development"></a>Releases and Daily Development</h2></div></div></div><p>Maintaining parallel releases simultaneously has implications
for how daily development is done.  In particular, it makes
practically mandatory a discipline that would be recommended anyway:
have each commit be a single logical change, and never mix unrelated
changes in the same commit.  If a change is too big or too disruptive
to do in one commit, break it across N commits, where each commit is a
well-partitioned subset of the overall change, and includes nothing
unrelated to the overall change.</p><p>Here's an example of an ill-thought-out commit:</p><pre class="screen">

Fix Issue #1729: Make indexing gracefully warn the user when a file
is changing as it is being indexed.

* ui/repl.py
  (ChangingFile): New exception class.
  (DoIndex): Handle new exception.

* indexer/index.py
  (FollowStream): Raise new exception if file changes during indexing.
  (BuildDir): Unrelatedly, remove some obsolete comments, reformat
  some code, and fix the error check when creating a directory.

Other unrelated cleanups:

* www/index.html: Fix some typos, set next release date.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>The problem with it becomes apparent as soon as someone needs to
port the <code class="function">BuildDir</code> error check fix over to a
branch for an upcoming maintenance release.  The porter doesn't want
any of the other changes&#8212;for example, perhaps the fix to issue
#1729 wasn't approved for the maintenance branch at all, and the
<code class="filename">index.html</code> tweaks would simply be irrelevant
there.  But she cannot easily grab just the
<code class="function">BuildDir</code> change via the version control tool's
merge functionality, because the version control system was told that
that change is logically grouped with all these other unrelated
things.  In fact, the problem would become apparent even before the
merge.  Merely listing the change for voting would become problematic:
instead of just giving the revision number, the proposer would have to
make a special patch or change branch just to isolate the portion of
the commit being proposed.  That would be a lot of work for others to
suffer through, and all because the original committer couldn't be
bothered to break things into logical groups.</p><p>In fact, that commit really should have been
<span class="emphasis"><em>four</em></span> separate commits: one to fix issue
#1729, another to remove obsolete comments and reformat code in
<code class="function">BuildDir</code>, another to fix the error check in
<code class="function">BuildDir</code>, and finally, one to tweak
<code class="filename">index.html</code>.  The third of those commits would be
the one proposed for the maintenance release branch.</p><p>Of course, release stabilization is not the only reason why
having each commit be one logical change is desirable.
Psychologically, a semantically unified commit is easier to review,
and easier to revert if necessary (in some version control systems,
reversion is really a special kind of merge anyway).  A little
up-front discipline on everyone's part can save the project a lot of
headache later.</p><div class="sect2" title="Planning Releases"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="planning"></a>Planning Releases</h3></div></div></div><p>One area where open source projects have historically differed
from proprietary projects is in release planning.  Proprietary
projects usually have firmer deadlines.  Sometimes it's because
customers were promised that an upgrade would be available by a
certain date, because the new release needs to be coordinated with
some other effort for marketing purposes, or because the venture
capitalists who invested in the whole thing need to see some results
before they put in any more funding.  Free software projects, on the
other hand, were until recently mostly motivated by amateurism in the
most literal sense: they were written for the love of it.  No one felt
the need to ship before all the features were ready, and why should
they?  It wasn't as if anyone's job was on the line.</p><p>Nowadays, many open source projects are funded by corporations,
and are correspondingly more and more influenced by deadline-conscious
corporate culture.  This is in many ways a good thing, but it can
cause conflicts between the priorities of those developers who are
being paid and those who are volunteering their time.  These conflicts
often happen around the issue of when and how to schedule releases.
The salaried developers who are under pressure will naturally want to
just pick a date when the releases will occur, and have everyone's
activities fall into line.  But the volunteers may have other
agendas&#8212;perhaps features they want to complete, or some testing
they want to have done&#8212;that they feel the release should wait
on.</p><p>There is no general solution to this problem except discussion
and compromise, of course.  But you can minimize the frequency and
degree of friction caused, by decoupling the proposed
<span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a given release from the date when
it would go out the door.  That is, try to steer discussion toward the
subject of which releases the project will be making in the near- to
medium-term future, and what features will be in them, without at
first mentioning anything about dates, except for rough guesses with
wide margins of error.  By nailing down feature sets early, you reduce
the complexity of the discussion centered on any individual release,
and therefore improve predictability.  This also creates a kind of
inertial bias against anyone who proposes to expand the definition of
a release by adding new features or other complications.  If the
release's contents are fairly well defined, the onus is on the
proposer to justify the expansion, even though the date of the release
may not have been set yet.</p><p>In his multi-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
<em class="citetitle">Jefferson and His Time</em>, Dumas Malone tells the
story of how Jefferson handled the first meeting held to decide the
organization of the future University of Virginia.  The University had
been Jefferson's idea in the first place, but (as is the case
everywhere, not just in open source projects) many other parties had
climbed on board quickly, each with their own interests and agendas.
When they gathered at that first meeting to hash things out, Jefferson
made sure to show up with meticulously prepared architectural
drawings, detailed budgets for construction and operation, a proposed
curriculum, and the names of specific faculty he wanted to import from
Europe.  No one else in the room was even remotely as prepared; the
group essentially had to capitulate to Jefferson's vision, and the
University was eventually founded more or less in accordance with his
plans.  The facts that construction went far over budget, and that
many of his ideas did not, for various reasons, work out in the end,
were all things Jefferson probably knew perfectly well would happen.
His purpose was strategic: to show up at the meeting with something so
substantive that everyone else would have to fall into the role of
simply proposing modifications to it, so that the overall shape, and
therefore schedule, of the project would be roughly as he
wanted.</p><p>In the case of a free software project, there is no single
"meeting", but instead a series of small proposals made mostly by
means of the issue tracker.  But if you have some credibility in the
project to start with, and you start assigning various features,
enhancements, and bugs to target releases in the issue tracker,
according to some announced overall plan, people will mostly go along
with you.  Once you've got things laid out more or less as you want
them, the conversations about actual release
<span class="emphasis"><em>dates</em></span> will go much more smoothly.</p><p>It is crucial, of course, to never present any individual
decision as written in stone.  In the comments associated with each
assignment of an issue to a specific future release, invite
discussion, dissent, and be genuinely willing to be persuaded whenever
possible.  Never exercise control merely for the sake of exercising
control: the more deeply others participate in the release planning
process (see
<a class="xref" href="#share-management" title="Rozdzielaj zarówno zadania techniczne jak i kierownicze">&#8222;Rozdzielaj zarówno zadania techniczne jak i kierownicze&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#managing-volunteers" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8. Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami">Rozdzia&#322; 8, <i>Zarz&#261;dzanie ochotnikami</i></a></span>), the easier it
will be to persuade them to share your priorities on the issues that
really count for you.</p><p>The other way the project can lower tensions around release
planning is to make releases fairly often.  When there's a long time
between releases, the importance of any individual release is
magnified in everyone's minds; people are that much more crushed when
their code doesn't make it in, because they know how long it might be
until the next chance.  Depending on the complexity of the release
process and the nature of your project, somewhere between every three
and six months is usually about the right gap between releases, though
maintenance lines may put out micro releases a bit faster, if there is
demand for them.</p></div></div></div><div class="chapter" title="Rozdzia&#322; 8.

wsadowym. Programy, które wykorzystuj&#261; g&#322;ównie graficzne interfejsy 
u&#380;ytkownika, s&#261; znacznie trudniejsze do opracowania programistycznie. 
Inny problem z mechanizmem testowania regresji polega na tym, &#380;e sam 
zestaw testów jest zwykle do&#347;&#263; z&#322;o&#380;ony i ma swoj&#261; w&#322;asn&#261; krzyw&#261; uczenia

zwykle odczuwa umiarkowane za&#380;enowanie i staje si&#281; obiektem docinków. 
Projekty posiadaj&#261;ce zestaw testów regresji zwykle stosuj&#261; te&#380; dodatkow&#261; 
regu&#322;&#281;: nie wprowadzaj zmian, przez które testy ko&#324;cz&#261; si&#281;

zestaw testów wykonywany jest co noc, a informacje o wynikach s&#261; 
przesy&#322;ane na robocz&#261; list&#281; dyskusyjn&#261; lub na osobn&#261; list&#281;, przeznaczon&#261;

uwa&#380;ane za odpowiedzialne zachowanie, jest to tak&#380;e wyj&#261;tkowa okazja do 
wspó&#322;pracy: zazwyczaj dwóch programistów dzieli si&#281; prac&#261; przy 
naprawianiu b&#322;&#281;dów, przy czym jeden pisze &#322;atk&#281;, a drugi test. Cz&#281;sto 
okazuje si&#281;, &#380;e tego drugiego czeka wi&#281;cej pracy, a poniewa&#380; ju&#380; samo 
pisanie testów daje mniej satysfakcji ni&#380; faktyczne naprawienie b&#322;&#281;dów, 
to nakazem jest, aby zestaw testów nie by&#322; bardziej m&#281;cz&#261;cy ni&#380; to 
konieczne.</p><p>Niektóre projekty id&#261; w tym jeszcze dalej, wymagaj&#261;c aby 
<span class="emphasis"><em>ka&#380;dej</em></span> poprawce lub nowej funkcji towarzyszy&#322; nowy

od natury danego oprogramowania, organizacji zespo&#322;u oraz od stopnia 
trudno&#347;ci pisania nowych testów. Projekt CVS (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.cvshome.org/" target="_top">http://www.cvshome.org/</a>) ma takie wymogi od dawna. Teoretycznie 
jest to dobra zasada, poniewa&#380; CVS to system kontroli wersji i z tego 
powodu stara si&#281; unika&#263; ryzyka zamazania lub niew&#322;a&#347;ciwego potraktowania 
danych u&#380;ytkownika. W praktyce problem z zestawem testów regresji w CVS 
polega na tym, &#380;e jest to jeden ogromny skrypt pow&#322;oki (jak na ironi&#281; 
nazwany <code class="filename">sanity.sh</code>, czyli "rozs&#261;dek"), który trudno 
jest rozczyta&#263;, modyfikowa&#263; czy rozszerza&#263;. Trudno&#347;&#263; w dodawaniu nowych 
testów w po&#322;&#261;czeniu z wymaganiem, aby do &#322;atek by&#322;y do&#322;&#261;czane nowe 
testy, powoduje &#380;e CVS praktycznie zniech&#281;ca twórców &#322;atek. Kiedy 
pracowa&#322;em nad CVS, czasem by&#322;em &#347;wiadkiem tego jak ludzie zaczynali, a 
nawet uko&#324;czali &#322;atki do kodu projektu, ale rezygnowali gdy dowiedzieli 
si&#281; o konieczno&#347;ci dodania nowego testu do

different things.  It can mean translating the software's
documentation into other languages, or it can mean translating the
software itself&#8212;that is, having the program display errors and
help messages in the user's preferred language.  Both are complex
tasks, but once the right infrastructure is in place, they are largely
separable from other development.  Because the tasks are similar in
some ways, it may make sense (depending on your project) to have a
single translation manager handle both, or it may be better to have
two different managers.</p><p>In the Subversion project, we have one translation manager
handle both.  He does not actually write the translations himself, of
course&#8212;he may help out on one or two, but as of this writing, he
would need to speak ten languages (twelve counting dialects) in order
to work on all of them!  Instead, he manages teams of volunteer
translators: he helps them coordinate among each other, and he
coordinates between the teams and the rest of the project.</p><p>Part of the reason the translation manager is necessary is that
translators are a different demographic from developers.  They
sometimes have little or no experience working in a version control
repository, or indeed with working as part of a distributed volunteer
team at all.  But in other respects they are often the best kind of
volunteer: people with specific domain knowledge who saw a need and
chose to get involved.  They are usually willing to learn, and
enthusiastic to get to work.  All they need is someone to tell them
how.  The translation manager makes sure that the translations happen
in a way that does not interfere unnecessarily with regular
development.  He also serves as a sort of representative of the
translators as a unified body, whenever the developers must be
informed of technical changes required to support the translation
effort.</p><p>Thus, the position's most important skills are diplomatic, not
technical.  For example, in Subversion we have a policy that all
translations should have at least two people working on them, because
otherwise there is no way for the text to be reviewed.  When a new
volunteer shows up offering to translate Subversion to, say, Malagasy,
the translation manager has to either hook him up with someone who
posted six months ago expressing interest in doing a Malagasy
translation, or else politely ask the volunteer to go
find <span class="emphasis"><em>another</em></span> Malagasy translator to work with as
a partner.  Once enough people are available, the manager sets them up
with the proper kind of commit access, informs them of the project's
conventions (such as how to write log messages), and then keeps an eye
out to make sure they adhere to those conventions.</p><p>Conversations between the translation manager and the
developers, or between the translation manager and translation teams,
are usually held in the project's original language&#8212;that is, the
language from which all the translations are being made.  For most
free software projects, this is English, but it doesn't matter what it
is as long as the project agrees on it.  (English is probably best for
projects that want to attract a broad international development
community, though.)</p><p>Conversations <span class="emphasis"><em>within</em></span> a particular
translation team usually happen in their shared language, however, and
one of the other tasks of the translation manager is to set up a
dedicated mailing list for each team.  That way the translators can
discuss their work freely, without distracting people on the project's
main lists, most of whom would not be able to understand the
translation language anyway.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Internacjonalizacja a lokalizacja"><a name="i7n"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Internacjonalizacja a lokalizacja</b></p></div></div></div><p><em class="firstterm">Internationalization</em>
  (<em class="firstterm">I18N</em>) and <em class="firstterm">localization</em>
  (<em class="firstterm">L10N</em>) both refer to the process of adapting
  a program to work in linguistic and cultural environments other than
  the one for which it was originally written.  The terms are often
  treated as interchangeable, but in fact they are not quite the same
  thing.  As <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G11n" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G11n</a>
  writes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The distinction between them is subtle but important:
     Internationalization is the adaptation of products
     for <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span> use virtually everywhere, while
     localization is the addition of special features for use in
     a <span class="emphasis"><em>specific</em></span> locale.</p></blockquote></div><p>For example, changing your software to losslessly handle
  Unicode (<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode</a>) text
  encodings is an internationalization move, since it's not about a
  particular language, but rather about accepting text from any of a
  number of languages.  On the other hand, making your software print
  all error messages in Slovenian, when it detects that it is running
  in a Slovenian environment, is a localization move.</p><p>Thus, the translation manager's task is principally about
  localization, not internationalization.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Mened&#380;er dokumentacji"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="documentation-manager"></a>Mened&#380;er dokumentacji</h3></div></div></div><p>Keeping software documentation up-to-date is a never-ending
task.  Every new feature or enhancement that goes into the code has
the potential to cause a change in the documentation.  Also, once the
project's documentation reaches a certain level of completeness, you
will find that a lot of the patches people send in are for the
documentation, not for the code.  This is because there are many more
people competent to fix bugs in prose than in code: all users are
readers, but only a few are programmers.</p><p>Documentation patches are usually much easier to review and
apply than code patches.  There is little or no testing to be done,
and the quality of the change can be evaluated quickly just by review.
Since the quantity is high, but the review burden fairly low, the
ratio of administrative overhead to productive work is greater for
documentation patches than for code patches.  Furthermore, most of the
patches will probably need some sort of adjustment, in order to
maintain a consistent authorial voice in the documentation.  In many
cases, patches will overlap with or affect other patches, and need to
be adjusted with respect to each other before being committed.</p><p>Given the exigencies of handling documentation patches, and the
fact that the code base needs to be constantly monitored so the
documentation can be kept up-to-date, it makes sense to have one
person, or a small team, dedicated to the task.  They can keep a
record of exactly where and how the documentation lags behind the
software, and they can have practiced procedures for handling large
quantities of patches in an integrated way.</p><p>Of course, this does not preclude other people in the project
from applying documentation patches on the fly, especially small ones,
as time permits.  And the same patch manager (see
<a class="xref" href="#patch-manager" title="Mened&#380;er &#322;atek">&#8222;Mened&#380;er &#322;atek&#8221;</a><span> earlier
in this chapter</span>) can track both code and
documentation patches, filing them wherever the development and
documentation teams want them, respectively.  (If the total quantity of
patches ever exceeds one human's capacity to track, though, switching
to separate patch managers for code and documentation is probably a
good first step.)  The point of a documentation team is to have people
who think of themselves as responsible for keeping the documentation
organized, up-to-date, and consistent with itself.  In practice, this
means knowing the documentation intimately, watching the code base,
watching the changes
<span class="emphasis"><em>others</em></span> commit to the documentation, watching for
incoming documentation patches, and using all these information
sources to do whatever is necessary to keep the documentation
healthy.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Mened&#380;er zg&#322;osze&#324;"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="issue-manager"></a>Mened&#380;er zg&#322;osze&#324;</h3></div></div></div><p>The number of issues in a project's bug tracker grows in
proportion to the number of people using the software.  Therefore,
even as you fix bugs and ship an increasingly robust program, you
should still expect the number of open issues to grow essentially
without bound.  The frequency of duplicate issues will also increase,
as will the frequency of incomplete or poorly described issues.</p><p>Issue managers help alleviate these problems by watching what
goes into the database, and periodically sweeping through it looking
for specific problems.  Their most common action is probably to fix up
incoming issues, either because the reporter didn't set some of the
form fields correctly, or because the issue is a duplicate of one
already in the database.  Obviously, the more familiar an issue
manager is with the project's bug database, the more efficiently she
will be able to detect duplicate issues&#8212;this is one of the main
advantages of having a few people specialize in the bug database,
instead of everyone trying to do it <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hoc</em></span>.  When the group tries to do it in a decentralized
manner, no single individual acquires a deep expertise in the content
of the database.</p><p>Issue managers can also help map between issues and individual
developers.  When there are a lot of bug reports coming in, not every
developer may read the issue notification mailing list with equal
attention.  However, if someone who knows the development team is
keeping an eye on all incoming issues, then she can discreetly direct
certain developers' attention to specific bugs when appropriate.  Of
course, this has to be done with a sensitivity to everything else
going on in development, and to the recipient's desires and
temperament.  Therefore, it is often best for issue managers to be
developers themselves.</p><p>Depending on how your project uses the issue tracker, issue
managers can also shape the database to reflect the project's
priorities.  For example, in Subversion we schedule issues into
specific future releases, so that when someone asks "When will bug X
be fixed?" we can say "Two releases from now," even if we can't give
an exact date.  The releases are represented in the issue tracker as
target milestones, a field available in
IssueZilla.<sup>[<a name="idp9133920" href="#ftn.idp9133920" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup> As a rule, every
Subversion release has one major new feature and a list of specific
bug fixes.  We assign the appropriate target milestone to all the
issues planned for that release (including the new feature&#8212;it
gets an issue too), so that people can view the bug database through
the lens of release scheduling.  These targets rarely remain static,
however.  As new bugs come in, priorities sometimes get shifted
around, and issues must be moved from one milestone to another so that
each release remains manageable.  This, again, is best done by people
who have an overall sense of what's in the database, and how various
issues relate to each other.</p><p>Another thing issue managers do is notice when issues become
obsolete.  Sometimes a bug is fixed accidentally as part of an
unrelated change to the software, or sometimes the project changes its
mind about whether a certain behavior is buggy.  Finding obsoleted
issues is not easy: the only way to do it systematically is by making
a sweep over all the issues in the database.  Full sweeps become less
and less feasible over time, however, as the number of issues grows.
After a certain point, the only way to keep the database sane is to use a
divide-and-conquer approach: categorize issues immediately on arrival
and direct them to the appropriate developer's or team's attention.
The recipient then takes charge of the issue for the rest of its
lifetime, shepherding it to resolution or oblivion as necessary.  When
the database is that large, the issue manager becomes more of an
overall coordinator, spending less time looking at each issue herself
and more time getting it into the right person's hands.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Mened&#380;er FAQ"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="faq-manager"></a>Mened&#380;er FAQ</h3></div></div></div><p>FAQ maintenance is a surprisingly difficult problem.  Unlike
most other documents in a project, whose content is planned out in
advance by the authors, a FAQ is a wholly reactive document (see
<a class="xref" href="#starting-a-faq" title="Maintaining a FAQ">Maintaining a FAQ</a>).  No matter how big it gets, you
still never know what the next addition will be.  And because it is
always added to piecemeal, it is very easy for the document as a whole
to become incoherent and disorganized, and even to contain duplicate
or semi-duplicate entries.  Even when it does not have any obvious
problems like that, there are often unnoticed interdependencies
between items&#8212;links that should be made but aren't&#8212;because
the related items were added a year apart.</p><p>The role of a FAQ manager is twofold.  First, she maintains the
overall quality of the FAQ by staying familiar with at least the
topics of all the questions in it, so that when people add new items
that are duplicates of, or related to, existing items, the appropriate
adjustments can be made.  Second, she watches the project mailing
lists and other forums for recurring problems or questions, and to
write new FAQ entries based on this input.  This latter task can be
quite complex: one must be able to follow a thread, recognize the core
questions raised in it, post a proposed FAQ entry, incorporate
comments from others (since it's impossible for the FAQ manager to be
an expert in every topic covered by the FAQ), and sense when the
process is finished so the item can at last be added.</p><p>The FAQ manager usually also becomes the default expert in FAQ
formatting.  There are a lot of little details involved in keeping a
FAQ in shape (see
<a class="xref" href="#all-as-archives" title="Treat all resources like archives">&#8222;Treat all resources like archives&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>); when random
people edit the FAQ, they will sometimes forget some of these details.
That's okay, as long as the FAQ manager is there to clean up after
them.</p><p>Various free software is available to help with the process of
FAQ maintenance.  It's fine to use it, as long as it doesn't
compromise the quality of the FAQ, but beware of over-automation.
Some projects try to fully automate the process of FAQ maintenance,
allowing everyone to contribute and edit FAQ items in a manner similar
to a wiki (see <a class="xref" href="#wikis" title="Wikis">&#8222;Wikis&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>).  I've
seen this happen particularly with Faq-O-Matic
(<a class="ulink" href="http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">http://faqomatic.sourceforge.net/</a>), though it may be
that the cases I saw were simply abuses that went beyond what
Faq-O-Matic was originally intended for.  In any case, while complete
decentralization of FAQ maintenance does reduce the workload for the
project, it also results in a poorer FAQ.  There's no one person with
a broad view of the entire FAQ, no one to notice when certain items
need updating or become obsolete entirely, and no one keeping watch for
interdependencies between items.  The result is a FAQ that often fails
to provide users what they were looking for, and in the worst cases
misleads them.  Use whatever tools you need to to maintain your
project's FAQ, but never let the convenience of the tools seduce you
into compromising the quality of the FAQ.</p><p>See Sean Michael Kerner's article, <em class="citetitle">The FAQs on
FAQs</em>, at

responsibility (e.g., patch manager, translation manager, etc.) will
become unable to perform the duties of the position.  It may be
because the job turned out to be more work than he anticipated, or it
may be due to completely external factors: marriage, a new baby, a new
employer, or whatever.</p><p>When a volunteer gets swamped like this, he usually doesn't
notice it right away.  It happens by slow degrees, and there's no
point at which he consciously realizes that he can no longer fulfill
the duties of the role.  Instead, the rest of the project just doesn't
hear much from him for a while.  Then there will suddenly be a flurry
of activity, as he feels guilty for neglecting the project for so long
and sets aside a night to catch up.  Then you won't hear from him for
a while longer, and then there might or might not be another flurry.
But there's rarely an unsolicited formal resignation.  The volunteer
was doing the job in his spare time, so resigning would mean openly
acknowledging to himself that his spare time is permanently reduced.
People are often reluctant to do that.</p><p>Therefore, it's up to you and the others in the project to
notice what's happening&#8212;or rather, not happening&#8212;and to
ask the volunteer what's going on.  The inquiry should be friendly and
100% guilt-free.  Your purpose is to find out a piece
of information, not to make the person feel bad.  Generally, the
inquiry should be visible to the rest of the project, but if you know
of some special reason why a private inquiry would be better, that's
fine too.  The main reason to do it publicly is so that if the
volunteer responds by saying that he won't be able to do the job
anymore, there's a context established for your
<span class="emphasis"><em>next</em></span> public post: a request for a new volunteer
to fill that role.</p><p>Sometimes, a volunteer is unable to do the job he's taken on,
but is either unaware or unwilling to admit that fact.  Of course,
anyone may have trouble at first, especially if the responsibility is
complex.  However, if someone just isn't working out in the task he's
taken on, even after everyone else has given all the help and
suggestions they can, then the only solution is for him to step aside
and let someone new have a try.  And if the person doesn't see this
himself, he'll need to be told.  There's basically only one way to
handle this, I think, but it's a multistep process and each step is
important.</p><p>First, make sure you're not crazy.  Privately talk to others in
the project to see if they agree that the problem is as serious as you
think it is.  Even if you're already positive, this serves the purpose
of letting others know that you're considering asking the person to
step aside.  Usually no one will object to that&#8212;they'll just be
happy you're taking on the awkward task, so they don't have to!</p><p>Next, <span class="emphasis"><em>privately</em></span> contact the volunteer in
question and tell him, kindly but directly, about the problems you
see.  Be specific, giving as many examples as possible.  Make sure to
point out how people had tried to help, but that the problems
persisted without improving.  You should expect this email to take a
long time to write, but with this sort of message, if you don't back
up what you're saying, you shouldn't say it at all.  Say that you
would like to find a new volunteer to fill the role, but also point
out that there are many other ways to contribute to the project.  At
this stage, don't say that you've talked to others about it; nobody
likes to be told that people were conspiring behind his back.</p><p>There are a few different ways things can go after that.  The
most likely reaction is that he'll agree with you, or at any rate not
want to argue, and be willing to step down.  In that case, suggest
that he make the announcement himself, and then you can follow up with
a post seeking a replacement.</p><p>Or, he may agree that there have been problems, but ask for a
little more time (or for one more chance, in the case of discrete-task
roles like release manager).  How you react to that is a judgement
call, but whatever you do, don't agree to it just because you feel
like you can't refuse such a reasonable request.  That would prolong
the agony, not lessen it.  There is often a very good reason to refuse
the request, namely, that there have already been plenty of chances,
and that's how things got to where they are now.  Here's how I put it
in a mail to someone who was filling the release manager role but was
not really suited for it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><pre class="screen">
&gt; If you wish to replace me with some one else, I will gracefully
&gt; pass on the role to who comes next.  I have one request, which
&gt; I hope is not unreasonable.  I would like to attempt one more
&gt;  release in an effort to prove myself.

I totally understand the desire (been there myself!), but in
this case, we shouldn't do the "one more try" thing.

This isn't the first or second release, it's the sixth or
seventh... And for all of those, I know you've been dissatisfied
with the results too (because we've talked about it before).  So
we've effectively already been down the one-more-try route.
Eventually, one of the tries has to be the last one... I think
[this past release] should be it.
</pre></blockquote></div><p>In the worst case, the volunteer may disagree outright.  Then
you have to accept that things are going to be awkward and plow ahead
anyway.  Now is the time to say that you talked to other people about
it (but still don't say who until you have their permission, since
those conversations were confidential), and that you don't think it's
good for the project to continue as things are.  Be insistent, but
never threatening.  Keep in mind that with most roles, the transition
really happens the moment someone new starts doing the job,
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> the moment the old person stops doing it.
For example, if the contention is over the role of, say, issue
manager, at any point you and other influential people in the project
can solicit for a new issue manager.  It's not actually necessary that
the person who was previously doing it stop doing it, as long as he
does not sabotage (deliberately or otherwise) the efforts of the new
volunteer.</p><p>Which leads to a tempting thought: instead of asking the person
to resign, why not just frame it as a matter of getting him some help?
Why not just have two issue managers, or patch managers, or whatever
the role is?</p><p>Although that may sound nice in theory, it is generally not a
good idea.  What makes the manager roles work&#8212;what makes them
useful, in fact&#8212;is their centralization.  Those things that can
be done in a decentralized fashion are usually already being done that
way.  Having two people fill one managerial role introduces
communications overhead between those two people, as well as the
potential for slippery displacement of responsibility ("I thought you
brought the first aid kit!"  "Me?  No, I thought
<span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> brought the first aid kit!").  Of course,
there are exceptions.  Sometimes two people work extremely well
together, or the nature of the role is such that it can easily be
spread across multiple people.  But these are not likely to be of much
use when you see someone flailing in a role he is not suited for.  If
he'd appreciated the problem in the first place, he would have sought
such help before now.  In any case, it would be disrespectful to let
someone waste time continuing to do a job no one will pay attention
to.</p><p>The most important factor in asking someone to step down is
privacy: giving him the space to make a decision without feeling like
others are watching and waiting.  I once made the mistake&#8212;an
obvious mistake, in retrospect&#8212;of mailing all three parties at
once in order to ask Subversion's release manager to step aside in
favor of two other volunteers.  I'd already talked to the two new
people privately, and knew that they were willing to take on the
responsibility.  So I thought, naïvely and somewhat
insensitively, that I'd save some time and hassle by sending one mail
to all of them to initiate the transition.  I assumed that the current
release manager was already fully aware of the problems and would see
the reasonableness of my point immediately.</p><p>I was wrong.  The current release manager was very offended, and
rightly so.  It's one thing to be asked to hand off the job; it's
another thing to be asked that <span class="emphasis"><em>in front of</em></span> the
people you'll hand it off to.  Once I got it through my head why he
was offended, I apologized.  He eventually did step aside gracefully,
and continues to be involved with the project today.  But his
feelings were hurt, and needless to say, this was not the most
auspicious of beginnings for the new volunteers either.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Prawo zapisu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="committers"></a>Prawo zapisu</h2></div></div></div><p>As the only formally distinct class of people found in all open
source projects, committers deserve special attention here.
Committers are an unavoidable concession to discrimination in a system
which is otherwise as non-discriminatory as possible.  But
"discrimination" is not meant as a pejorative here.  The function
committers perform is utterly necessary, and I do not think a project
could succeed without it.  Quality control requires, well, control.
There are always many people who feel competent to make changes to a
program, and some smaller number who actually are.  The project cannot
rely on people's own judgement; it must impose standards and grant
commit access only to those who meet them<sup>[<a name="idp9373776" href="#ftn.idp9373776" class="footnote">26</a>]</sup>.  On the other
hand, having people who can commit changes directly working
side-by-side with people who cannot sets up an obvious power dynamic.
That dynamic must be managed so that it does not harm the
project.</p><p>In <a class="xref" href="#electorate" title="Who Votes?">&#8222;Who Votes?&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Rozdzia&#322; 4, <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>, we already
discussed the mechanics of considering new committers.  Here we will
look at the standards by which potential new committers should be
judged, and how this process should be presented to the larger
community.</p><div class="sect2" title="Przyznawanie prawa zapisu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="choosing-committers"></a>Przyznawanie prawa zapisu</h3></div></div></div><p>In the Subversion project, we choose committers primarily on the
Hippocratic Principle: <span class="emphasis"><em>first, do no harm</em></span>.  Our
main criterion is not technical skill or even knowledge of the code,
but merely that the committer show good judgement.  Judgement can mean
simply knowing what not to take on.  A person might post only small
patches, fixing fairly simple problems in the code; but if the patches
apply cleanly, do not contain bugs, and are mostly in accord with the
project's log message and coding conventions, and there are enough
patches to show a clear pattern, then an existing committer will
usually propose that person for commit access.  If at least three
people say yes, and no one objects, then the offer is made.  True, we
might have no evidence that the person is able to solve complex
problems in all areas of the code base, but that does not matter: the
person has made it clear that he is capable of at least judging
his own abilities.  Technical skills can be learned (and taught),
but judgement, for the most part, cannot.  Therefore, it is the one
thing you want to make sure a person has before you give him commit
access.</p><p>When a new committer proposal does provoke a discussion, it is
usually not about technical ability, but rather about the person's
behavior on the mailing lists or in IRC.  Sometimes someone shows
technical skill and an ability to work within the project's formal
guidelines, yet is also consistently belligerent or uncooperative in
public forums.  That's a serious concern; if the person doesn't
seem to shape up over time, even in response to hints, then we won't
add him as a committer no matter how skilled he is.  In a
volunteer group, social skills, or the ability to "play well in the
sandbox", are as important as raw technical ability.  Because
everything is under version control, the penalty for adding a
committer you shouldn't have is not so much the problems it could
cause in the code (review would spot those quickly anyway), but that
it might eventually force the project to revoke the person's commit
access&#8212;an action that is never pleasant and can sometimes be
confrontational.</p><p>Many projects insist that the potential committer demonstrate a
certain level of technical expertise and persistence, by submitting
some number of nontrivial patches&#8212;that is, not only do these
projects want to know that the person will do no harm, they want to
know that she is likely to do good across the code base.  This is
fine, but be careful that it doesn't start to turn committership into
a matter of membership in an exclusive club.  The question to keep in
everyone's mind should be "What will bring the best results for the
code?" not "Will we devalue the social status associated with
committership by admitting this person?"  The point of commit access
is not to reinforce people's self-worth, it's to allow good changes to
enter the code with a minimum of fuss.  If you have 100
committers, 10 of whom make large changes on a regular basis, and the
other 90 of whom just fix typos and small bugs a few times a year,
that's still better than having only the 10.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Odbierania prawa zapisu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="revoking-committers"></a>Odbierania prawa zapisu</h3></div></div></div><p>The first thing to be said about revoking commit access is: try
not to be in that situation in the first place.  Depending on whose
access is being revoked, and why, the discussions around such an
action can be very divisive.  Even when not divisive, they will be a
time-consuming distraction from productive work.</p><p>However, if you must do it, the discussion should be had
privately among the same people who would be in a position to vote for
<span class="emphasis"><em>granting</em></span> that person whatever flavor of commit
access they currently have.  The person herself should not be
included.  This contradicts the usual injunction against secrecy, but
in this case it's necessary.  First, no one would be able to speak
freely otherwise.  Second, if the motion fails, you don't necessarily
want the person to know it was ever considered, because that could
open up questions ("Who was on my side?  Who was against me?") that
lead to the worst sort of factionalism.  In certain rare
circumstances, the group may want someone to know that revocation of
commit access is or was being considered, as a warning, but this
openness should be a decision the group makes.  No one should ever, on
her own initiative, reveal information from a discussion and ballot
that others assumed were secret.</p><p>Once someone's access is revoked, that fact is unavoidably
public (see
<a class="xref" href="#commit-access-openness" title="Unikaj tajemnic">&#8222;Unikaj tajemnic&#8221;</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>), so try to be as tactful as you can in
how it is presented to the outside world.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Cz&#281;&#347;ciowe prawo zapisu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="partial-committers"></a>Cz&#281;&#347;ciowe prawo zapisu</h3></div></div></div><p>Some projects offer gradations of commit access.  For example,
there might be contributors whose commit access gives them free rein
in the documentation, but who do not commit to the code itself.
Common areas for partial commit access include documentation,
translations, binding code to other programming languages,
specification files for packaging (e.g., RedHat RPM spec files,
etc.), and other places where a mistake will not result in a problem for
the core project.</p><p>Since commit access is not only about committing, but about
being part of an electorate (see
<a class="xref" href="#electorate" title="Who Votes?">&#8222;Who Votes?&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Rozdzia&#322; 4, <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>),
the question naturally arises: what can the partial committers vote
on?  There is no one right answer; it depends on what sorts of partial
commit domains your project has.  In Subversion we've kept things
fairly simple: a partial committer can vote on matters confined
exclusively to that committer's domain, and not on anything else.
Importantly, we do have a mechanism for casting advisory votes
(essentially, the committer writes "+0" or "+1 (non-binding)"
instead of just "+1" on the ballot).  There's no reason to silence
people entirely just because their vote isn't formally binding.</p><p>Full committers can vote on anything, just as they can commit
anywhere, and only full committers vote on adding new committers of
any kind.  In practice, though, the ability to add new partial
committers is usually delegated: any full committer can "sponsor" a
new partial committer, and partial committers in a domain can often
essentially choose new committers for that same domain (this is
especially helpful in making translation work run smoothly).</p><p>Your project may need a slightly different arrangement,
depending on the nature of the work, but the same general principles
apply to all projects.  Each committer should be able to vote on
matters that fall within the scope of her commit access, and not on
matters outside that, and votes on procedural questions should default
to the full committers, unless there's some reason (as decided by the
full committers) to widen the electorate.</p><p>Regarding enforcement of partial commit access: it's often
best <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to have the version control system
enforce partial commit domains, even if it can.  See
<a class="xref" href="#vc-authz" title="Authorization">&#8222;Authorization&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span> for the
reasons why.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Niewykorzystywane prawo zapisu"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="dormant-committers"></a>Niewykorzystywane prawo zapisu</h3></div></div></div><p>Some projects automatically remove people's commit access if
they go a certain amount of time (say, a year) without committing
anything.  I think this is usually unhelpful and even
counterproductive, for two reasons.</p><p>First, it may tempt some people into committing acceptable but
unnecessary changes, just to prevent their commit access from
expiring.  Second, it doesn't really serve any purpose.  If the
main criterion for granting commit access is good judgement, then why
assume someone's judgement would deteriorate just because he's away
from the project for a while?  Even if he completely vanishes for
years, not looking at the code or following development discussions,
when he reappears he'll <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> how out of touch
he is, and act accordingly.  You trusted his judgement before, so
why not trust it always?  If high school diplomas do not expire, then
commit access certainly shouldn't.</p><p>Sometimes a committer may ask to be removed, or to be explicitly
marked as dormant in the list of committers (see
<a class="xref" href="#commit-access-openness" title="Unikaj tajemnic">&#8222;Unikaj tajemnic&#8221;</a><span>
below</span> for more about that list).  In these cases, the project
should accede to the person's wishes, of course.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Unikaj tajemnic"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="commit-access-openness"></a>Unikaj tajemnic</h3></div></div></div><p>Although the discussions around adding any particular new
committer must be confidential, the rules and procedures themselves
need not be secret.  In fact, it's best to publish them, so people
realize that the committers are not some mysterious Star Chamber,
closed off to mere mortals, but that anyone can join simply by posting
good patches and knowing how to handle herself in the community.
In the Subversion project, we put this information right in the
developer guidelines document, since the people most likely to be
interested in how commit access is granted are those thinking of
contributing code to the project.</p><p>In addition to publishing the procedures, publish the
actual <span class="emphasis"><em>list</em></span> of committers.  The traditional place
for this is a file called <code class="filename">MAINTAINERS</code>
or <code class="filename">COMMITTERS</code> in the top level of the project's
source code tree.  It should list all the full committers first,
followed by the various partial commit domains and the members of each
domain.  Each person should be listed by name and email address,
though the address can be encoded to prevent spam (see
<a class="xref" href="#address-hiding" title="Ukrywanie adresów w archiwach">&#8222;Ukrywanie adresów w archiwach&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a></span>) if the
person prefers that.</p><p>Since the distinction between full commit and partial commit
access is obvious and well defined, it is proper for the list to make
that distinction too.  Beyond that, the list should not try to
indicate the informal distinctions that inevitably arise in a project,
such as who is particularly influential and how.  It is a public
record, not an acknowledgments file.  List committers either in
alphabetical order, or in the order in which they arrived.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Uznanie zas&#322;ug"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="credit"></a>Uznanie zas&#322;ug</h2></div></div></div><p>Credit is the primary currency of the free software world.
Whatever people may say about their motivations for participating in a
project, I don't know any developers who would be happy doing all
their work anonymously, or under someone else's name.  There are
tangible reasons for this: one's reputation in a project roughly
governs how much influence one has, and participation in an open
source project can also indirectly have monetary value, because
some employers now look for it on resumés.  There are also
intangible reasons, perhaps even more powerful: people simply want to
be appreciated, and instinctively look for signs that their work was
recognized by others.  The promise of credit is therefore one of best
motivators the project has.  When small contributions are
acknowledged, people come back to do more.</p><p>One of the most important features of collaborative development
software (see <a class="xref" href="#technical-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 3. Infrastruktura techniczna">Rozdzia&#322; 3, <i>Infrastruktura techniczna</i></a>) is that
it keeps accurate records of who did what, when.  Wherever possible,
use these existing mechanisms to make sure that credit is distributed
accurately, and be specific about the nature of the contribution.
Don't just write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;" if
instead you can write "Thanks to J. Random &lt;jrandom@example.com&gt;
for the bug report and reproduction recipe" in a log message.</p><p>In Subversion, we have an informal but consistent policy of
crediting the reporter of a bug in either the issue filed, if there is
one, or the log message of the commit that fixes the bug, if not.  A
quick survey of Subversion commit logs up to commit number 14525 shows
that about 10% of commits give credit to someone by name and email
address, usually the person who reported or analyzed the bug fixed by
that commit.  Note that this person is different from the developer
who actually made the commit, whose name is already recorded
automatically by the version control system.  Of the 80-odd full and
partial committers Subversion has today, 55 were credited in the
commit logs (usually multiple times) before they became committers
themselves.  This does not, of course, prove that being credited was a
factor in their continued involvement, but it at least sets up an
atmosphere in which people know they can count on their contributions
being acknowledged.</p><p>It is important to distinguish between routine acknowledgment
and special thanks.  When discussing a particular piece of code, or
some other contribution someone made, it is fine to acknowledge their
work.  For example, saying "Daniel's recent changes to the delta code
mean we can now implement feature X" simultaneously helps people
identify which changes you're talking about and acknowledges Daniel's
work.  On the other hand, posting solely to thank Daniel for the delta
code changes serves no immediate practical purpose.  It doesn't add
any information, since the version control system and other mechanisms
have already recorded the fact that he made the changes.  Thanking
everyone for everything would be distracting and ultimately
information-free, since thanks are effective largely by how much they
stand out from the default, background level of favorable comment
going on all the time.  This does not mean, of course, that you should
never thank people.  Just make sure to do it in ways that tend not to
lead to credit inflation.  Following these guidelines will
help:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The more ephemeral the forum, the more free you
            should feel to express thanks there.  For example,
            thanking someone for their bugfix in passing during an IRC
            conversation is fine, as is an aside in an email devoted
            mainly to other topics.  But don't post an email solely to
            thank someone, unless it's for a truly unusual feat.
            Likewise, don't clutter the project's web pages with
            expressions of gratitude.  Once you start that, it'll
            never be clear when or where to stop. And
            <span class="emphasis"><em>never</em></span> put thanks into comments in the
            code; that would only be a distraction from the primary
            purpose of comments, which is to help the reader
            understand the code.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The less involved someone is in the project, the
            more appropriate it is to thank her for something she
            did.  This may sound counterintuitive, but it fits with
            the attitude that expressing thanks is something you do
            when someone contributes even more than you thought she
            would.  Thus, to constantly thank regular contributors for
            doing what they normally do would be to express a lower
            expectation of them than they have of themselves.  If
            anything, you want to aim for the opposite effect!</p><p>There are occasional exceptions to this rule.  It's
            acceptable to thank someone for fulfilling his expected
            role when that role involves temporary, intense efforts
            from time to time.  The canonical example is the release
            manager, who goes into high gear around the time of each
            release, but otherwise lies dormant (dormant as a release
            manager, in any case&#8212;he may also be an active
            developer, but that's a different matter).
            </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>As with criticism and crediting, gratitude should
            be specific.  Don't thank people just for being great,
            even if they are.  Thank them for something they did that
            was out of the ordinary, and for bonus points, say
            exactly why what they did was so great.</p></li></ul></div><p>In general, there is always a tension between making sure that
people's individual contributions are recognized, and making sure the
project is a group effort rather than a collection of individual
glories.  Just remain aware of this tension and try to err on the
side of group, and things won't get out of hand.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Rozwidlenia"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="forks"></a>Rozwidlenia</h2></div></div></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="#forkability" title="Forkability">&#8222;Forkability&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#social-infrastructure" title="Rozdzia&#322; 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Rozdzia&#322; 4, <i>Social and Political Infrastructure</i></a></span>, we saw how
the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span> to fork has important effects on
how projects are governed.  But what happens when a fork actually
occurs?  How should you handle it, and what effects can you expect it
to have?  Conversely, when should you <span class="emphasis"><em>initiate</em></span> a
fork?</p><p>The answers depend on what kind of fork it is.  Some forks are
due to amicable but irreconcilable disagreements about the direction
of the project; perhaps more are due to both technical disagreements
and interpersonal conflicts.  Of course, it's not always possible to
tell the difference between the two, as technical arguments may
involve personal elements as well.  What all forks have in common is
that one group of developers (or sometimes even just one developer)
has decided that the costs of working with some or all of the others
now outweigh the benefits.</p><p>Once a project forks, there is no definitive answer to the
question of which fork is the "true" or "original" project.  People
will colloquially talk of fork F coming out of project P, as though P
is continuing unchanged down some natural path while F diverges into
new territory, but this is, in effect, a declaration of how that
particular observer feels about it.  It is fundamentally a matter of
perception: when a large enough percentage of observers agree, the
assertion starts to become true.  It is not the case that there is an
objective truth from the outset, one that we are only imperfectly able to
perceive at first.  Rather, the perceptions <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span>
the objective truth, since ultimately a project&#8212;or a
fork&#8212;is an entity that exists only in people's minds
anyway.</p><p>If those initiating the fork feel that they are
sprouting a new branch off the main project, the perception question
is resolved immediately and easily.  Everyone, both developers and
users, will treat the fork as a new project, with a new name (perhaps
based on the old name, but easily distinguishable from it), a separate
web site, and a separate philosophy or goal.  Things get messier,
however, when both sides feel they are the legitimate guardians of the
original project and therefore have the right to continue using the
original name.  If there is some organization with trademark rights to
the name, or legal control over the domain or web pages, that usually
resolves the issue by fiat: that organization will decide who is the
project and who is the fork, because it holds all the cards in a
public relations war.  Naturally, things rarely get that far: since
everyone already knows what the power dynamics are, they will avoid
fighting a battle whose outcome is known in advance, and just jump
straight to the end.</p><p>Fortunately, in most cases there is little doubt as to which is
the project and which is the fork, because a fork is, in essence, a vote
of confidence.  If more than half of the developers are in favor of
whatever course the fork proposes to take, usually there is no need to
fork&#8212;the project can simply go that way itself, unless it is run
as a dictatorship with a particularly stubborn dictator.  On the other
hand, if fewer than half of the developers are in favor, the fork is a
clearly minority rebellion, and both courtesy and common sense
indicate that it should think of itself as the divergent branch rather
than the main line.</p><div class="sect2" title="Obchodzenie si&#281; z rozwidleniami"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="forks-handling"></a>Obchodzenie si&#281; z rozwidleniami</h3></div></div></div><p>If someone threatens a fork in your project, keep calm and
remember your long-term goals.  The mere
<span class="emphasis"><em>existence</em></span> of a fork isn't what hurts a project;
rather, it's the loss of developers and users.  Your real aim,
therefore, is not to squelch the fork, but to minimize these harmful
effects.  You may be mad, you may feel that the fork was unjust and
uncalled for, but expressing that publicly can only alienate undecided
developers.  Instead, don't force people to make exclusive choices,
and be as cooperative as is practicable with the fork.  To start with,
don't remove someone's commit access in your project just because he
decided to work on the fork.  Work on the fork doesn't mean that
person has suddenly lost his competence to work on the original
project; committers before should remain committers afterward.  Beyond
that, you should express your desire to remain as compatible as
possible with the fork, and say that you hope developers will port
changes between the two whenever appropriate.  If you have
administrative access to the project's servers, publicly offer the
forkers infrastructure help at startup time.  For example, offer them
a complete, deep-history copy of the version control repository, if
there's no other way for them to get it, so that they don't have to
start off without historical data (this may not be necessary depending
on the version control system).  Ask them if there's anything else
they need, and provide it if you can.  Bend over backward to show
that you are not standing in the way, and that you want the fork to
succeed or fail on its own merits and nothing else.</p><p>The reason to do all this&#8212;and do it publicly&#8212;is not
to actually help the fork, but to persuade developers that your side
is a safe bet, by appearing as non-vindictive as possible.  In war it
sometimes makes sense (strategic sense, if not human sense) to force
people to choose sides, but in free software it almost never does.  In
fact, after a fork some developers often openly work on both projects,
and do their best to keep the two compatible.  These developers help
keep the lines of communication open after the fork.  They allow your
project to benefit from interesting new features in the fork (yes, the
fork may have things you want), and also increase the chances of a
merger down the road.</p><p>Sometimes a fork becomes so successful that, even though it was
regarded even by its own instigators as a fork at the outset, it
becomes the version everybody prefers, and eventually supplants the
original by popular demand.  A famous instance of this was the
GCC/EGCS fork.  The <em class="firstterm">GNU Compiler Collection</em>
(<em class="firstterm">GCC</em>, formerly the <em class="firstterm">GNU C
Compiler</em>) is the most popular open source native-code
compiler, and also one of the 
most portable compilers in the world.  Due to disagreements between the GCC's
official maintainers and Cygnus Software,<sup>[<a name="idp9445888" href="#ftn.idp9445888" class="footnote">27</a>]</sup> one
of GCC's most active developer groups, Cygnus created a fork of GCC
called <em class="firstterm">EGCS</em>.  The fork was deliberately
non-adversarial: the EGCS developers did not, at any point, try to
portray their version of GCC as a new official version.  Instead, they
concentrated on making EGCS as good as possible, incorporating patches
at a faster rate than the official GCC maintainers.  EGCS gained in
popularity, and eventually some major operating system distributors
decided to package EGCS as their default compiler instead of GCC.  At
this point, it became clear to the GCC maintainers that holding on to
the "GCC" name while everyone switched to the EGCS fork would burden
everyone with a needless name change, yet do nothing to prevent the
switchover.  So GCC adopted the EGCS codebase, and there is once again
a single GCC, but greatly improved because of the fork.</p><p>This example shows why you cannot always regard a fork as an
unadulteratedly bad thing.  A fork may be painful and unwelcome at the
time, but you cannot necessarily know whether it will succeed.
Therefore, you and the rest of the project should keep an eye on it,
and be prepared not only to absorb features and code where possible,
but in the most extreme case to even join the fork if it gains the
bulk of the project's mindshare.  Of course, you will often be able to
predict a fork's likelihood of success by seeing who joins it.  If the
fork is started by the project's biggest complainer and joined by a
handful of disgruntled developers who weren't behaving constructively
anyway, they've essentially solved a problem for you by forking, and
you probably don't need to worry about the fork taking momentum away
from the original project.  But if you see influential and respected
developers supporting the fork, you should ask yourself why.  Perhaps
the project was being overly restrictive, and the best solution is to
adopt into the mainline project some or all of the actions
contemplated by the fork&#8212;in essence, to avoid the fork by
becoming it.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Inicjowanie rozwidlenia"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="forks-initiating"></a>Inicjowanie rozwidlenia</h3></div></div></div><p>All the advice here assumes that you are forking as a last
resort.  Exhaust all other possibilities before starting a fork.
Forking almost always means losing developers, with only an uncertain
promise of gaining new ones later.  It also means starting out with
competition for users' attention: everyone who's about to download the
software has to ask themselves: "Hmm, do I want that one or the other
one?"  Whichever one you are, the situation is messy, because a
question has been introduced that wasn't there before.  Some people
maintain that forks are healthy for the software ecosystem as a whole,
by a standard natural selection argument: the fittest will survive,
which means that, in the end, everyone gets better software.  This may
be true from the ecosystem's point of view, but it's not true from the
point of view of any individual project.  Most forks do not succeed,
and most projects are not happy to be forked.</p><p>A corollary is that you should not use the threat of a fork as
an extremist debating technique&#8212;"Do things my way or I'll fork
the project!"&#8212;because everyone is aware that a fork that fails
to attract developers away from the original project is unlikely to
survive long.  All observers&#8212;not just developers, but users and
operating system packagers too&#8212;will make their own judgement about
which side to choose.  You should therefore appear extremely reluctant
to fork, so that if you finally do it, you can credibly claim it was
the only route left.</p><p>Do not neglect to take <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> factors into
account in evaluating the potential success of your fork.  For
example, if many of the developers on a project have the same
employer, then even if they are disgruntled and privately in favor of
a fork, they are unlikely to say so out loud if they know that their
employer is against it.  Many free software programmers like to think
that having a free license on the code means no one company can
dominate development.  It is true that the license is, in an ultimate
sense, a guarantor of freedom&#8212;if others want badly enough to
fork the project, and have the resources to do so, they can.  But in
practice, some projects' development teams are mostly funded by one
entity, and there is no point pretending that that entity's support
doesn't matter.  If it is opposed to the fork, its developers are
unlikely to take part, even if they secretly want to.</p><p>If you still conclude that you must fork, line up support
privately first, then announce the fork in a non-hostile tone.  Even
if you are angry at, or disappointed with, the current maintainers,
don't say that in the message.  Just dispassionately state what led
you to the decision to fork, and that you mean no ill will toward the
project from which you're forking.  Assuming that you do consider it a
fork (as opposed to an emergency preservation of the original
project), emphasize that you're forking the code and not the name, and
choose a name that does not conflict with the project's name.  You can
use a name that contains or refers to the original name, as long as it
does not open the door to identity confusion.  Of course it's fine to
explain prominently on the fork's home page that it descends from the
original program, and even that it hopes to supplant it.  Just don't
make users' lives harder by forcing them to untangle an identity
dispute.</p><p>Finally, you can get things started on the right foot by
automatically granting all committers of the original project commit
access to the fork, including even those who openly disagreed with the
need for a fork.  Even if they never use the access, your message is
clear: there are disagreements here, but no enemies, and you welcome
code contributions from any competent source.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp9124192" href="#idp9124192" class="para">23</a>] </sup>Nad tym pytaniem szczegó&#322;owo zastanawiali si&#281;, z

              General Public License (GPL), and who founded the Free
              Software Foundation (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/" target="_top">http://www.fsf.org/</a>)

              same range of software as "open source", the FSF, among
              others, prefers the former term because it emphasizes
              the idea of freedom, and the concept of
              freely redistributable software as primarily a social
              movement rather than a technical one.  The FSF
              acknowledges that the term is ambiguous&#8212;it could
              mean "free" as in "zero-cost", instead of "free" as in
              "freedom"&#8212;but feels that it's still the best term,
              all things considered, and that the other possibilities
              in English have their own ambiguities.  (Throughout this
              book, "free" is used in the "freedom" sense, not the

              as a deliberate alternative to "free software," in order
              to make such software a more palatable choice for
              corporations, by presenting it as a development
              methodology rather than a political movement.  They may
              also have wanted to overcome another stigma: that
              anything "free" must be low quality.</p><p>While any license that is free is also open
              source, and vice versa (with a few minor exceptions),
              people tend to pick one term and stick with it.  In
              general, those who prefer "free software" are more
              likely to have a philosophical or moral stance on the
              issue, while those who prefer "open source" either don't

              to have settled on FOSS, or sometimes F/OSS, standing
              for "Free / Open Source Software".  Another variant

              This is a widely-used test for whether a given license
              is truly open source
              (free, <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">libre</em></span>, etc.).  The
              Debian Project's mission is to maintain an entirely free
              operating system, such that someone installing it need
              never doubt that she has the right to modify and
              redistribute any or all of the system.  The Debian Free
              Software Guidelines are the requirements that a software
              package's license must meet in order to be included in
              Debian.  Because the Debian Project spent a good deal of
              time thinking about how to construct such a test, the
              guidelines they came up with have proven very robust
              (see <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG</a>),

              been raised either by the Free Software Foundation or
              the Open Source Initiative.  If you know that a given
              license is DFSG-compliant, you know that it guarantees
              all the important freedoms (such as forkability even
              against the original author's wishes) required to
              sustain the dynamics of an open source project.  All of

              another widely-used test of whether a license permits
              all the necessary freedoms.  The OSI's definition of
              open source software is based on the Debian Free
              Software Guidelines, and any license that meets one
              definition almost always meets the other.  There have
              been a few exceptions over the years, but only involving
              niche licenses and none of any relevance here.  Unlike
              the Debian Project, the OSI maintains a list of all

              <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/" target="_top">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/</a>, so
              that being "OSI-approved" is an unambiguous state: a

              The FSF categorizes licenses not only by whether they

              General Public License.  GPL compatibility is an
              important topic, covered in

              software distributed under traditional, royalty-based
              licensing terms, where users pay per copy, or under any
              other terms sufficiently restrictive to prevent open
              source dynamics from operating.  Even software
              distributed at no charge can still be proprietary, if
              its license does not permit free redistribution and
              modification.</p><p>Generally "proprietary" and "closed-source" are
              synonyms.  However, "closed-source" additionally implies
              that the source code cannot even be seen.  Since the
              source code cannot be seen with most proprietary
              software, this is normally a distinction without a
              difference.  However, occasionally someone releases
              proprietary software under a license that allows others
              to view the source code.  Confusingly, they sometimes
              call this "open source" or "nearly open source," etc.,
              but that's misleading. The
              <span class="emphasis"><em>visibility</em></span> of the source code is
              not the issue; the important question is what you're
              allowed to do with it.  Thus, the difference between
              proprietary and closed-source is mostly irrelevant, and
              the two can be treated as synonyms.</p><p>Sometimes <em class="firstterm">commercial</em> is
              used as a synonym for "proprietary," but properly
              speaking, the two are not the same thing.  Free software
              can be commercial software.  After all, free software
              can be sold, as long as the buyers are not restricted
              from giving away copies themselves.  It can be
              commercialized in other ways as well, for example by
              selling support, services, and certification.  There are
              multimillion dollar companies built on free software
              today, so it is clearly neither inherently
              anti-commercial nor anti-corporate.  On the other hand,
              it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> anti-proprietary by its
              nature, and this is the key way in which it differs from
              traditional per-copy license models.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">public domain</em></span></dt><dd><p>Having no copyright holder, meaning that there is
              no one who has the right to restrict copying of the
              work.  Being in the public domain is not the same as
              having no author.  Everything has an author, and even if a
              work's author or authors choose to put it in the public
              domain, that doesn't change the fact that they wrote
              it.</p><p>When a work is in the public domain, material from
              it can be incorporated into a copyrighted work, and
              thereafter <span class="emphasis"><em>that copy</em></span> of the
              material is covered under the same copyright as the
              whole work.  But this does not affect the availability
              of the original work, which remains in the public
              domain.  Thus, releasing something into the public
              domain is technically one way to make it "free,"
              according to the guidelines of most free software
              certifying organizations.  However, there are usually
              good reasons to use a license instead of just releasing
              into the public domain: even with free software, certain
              restrictions can be useful, not only to the copyright
              holder but even to recipients as well, as the next
              section makes clear.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">copyleft</em></span></dt><dd><p>A license that uses copyright law to achieve a
              result opposite to traditional copyright.  Depending on
              whom you ask, this means either licenses that permit
              the freedoms under discussion here, or, more narrowly,
              licenses that not only permit those freedoms but
              <span class="emphasis"><em>enforce</em></span> them, by stipulating that
              the freedoms must travel with the work.  The Free
              Software Foundation uses the second definition
              exclusively; elsewhere, it's a toss-up: a lot of people
              use the term the same way the FSF does, but
              others&#8212;including some who write for mainstream
              media&#8212;tend to use the first definition.  It's not
              clear that everyone using the term is aware that there's
              a distinction to be made.</p><p>The canonical example of the narrower, stricter
              definition is the GNU General Public License, which
              stipulates that any derivative works must also be
              licensed under the GPL; see

available, in the important respects they all say the same things:
that anyone can modify the code, that anyone can redistribute it both
in original and modified form, and that the copyright holders and
authors provide no warranties whatsoever (avoiding liability is
especially important given that people might run modified versions
without even knowing it).  The differences between licences boil down
to a few oft-recurring issues:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">compatibility with proprietary licenses</span></dt><dd><p>Some free licenses allow the covered code to be
              used in proprietary programs.  This does not affect the
              licensing terms of the proprietary program: it is still
              as proprietary as ever, it just happens to contain some
              code from a non-proprietary source.  The Apache License,
              X Consortium License, BSD-style license, and the
              MIT-style license are all examples of
              proprietary-compatible licenses.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">compatibility with other free licenses</span></dt><dd><p>Most free licenses are compatible with each other,
              meaning that code under one license can be combined with
              code under another, and the result distributed under
              either license without violating the terms of the
              other.  The major exception to this is the GNU General
              Public License, which requires that any work using GPLed
              code be itself distributed under the GPL, and without
              adding any further restrictions beyond what the GPL
              requires.  The GPL is compatible with some free
              licenses, but not with others.  This is discussed in more
              detail in
              <a class="xref" href="#license-compatibility" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">&#8222;The GPL and License Compatibility&#8221;</a><span> later in this chapter</span>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">enforcement of crediting</span></dt><dd><p>Some free licenses stipulate that any use of the
              covered code be accompanied by a notice, whose placement
              and display is usually specified, giving credit to the
              authors or copyright holders of the code.  These
              licenses are often still proprietary-compatible: they do
              not necessarily demand that the derivative work be free,
              merely that credit be given to the free code.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">protection of trademark</span></dt><dd><p>A variant of credit enforcement.
              Trademark-protecting licenses specify that the name of
              the original software (or its copyright holders, or
              their institution, etc.) may <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
              used by derivative works without prior written
              permission.  Although credit enforcement insists that a
              certain name be used, and trademark protection insists
              that it not be used, they are both expressions of the
              same desire: that the original code's reputation be
              preserved and transmitted, but not tarnished by
              association.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">protection of "artistic integrity"</span></dt><dd><p>Some licenses (the Artistic License, used
              for the most popular implementation of the Perl
              programming language, and Donald Knuth's TeX license,
              for example) require that modification and
              redistribution be done in a manner that distinguishes
              clearly between the pristine original version of the
              code and any modifications.  They permit essentially the
              same freedoms as other free license, but impose certain
              requirements that make the integrity of the original
              code easy to verify.  These licenses have not caught on
              much beyond the specific programs they were made for,
              and will not be discussed in this chapter; they are
              mentioned here only for the sake of completeness.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Most of these stipulations are not mutually exclusive, and some
licenses include several.  The common thread among them is that they
place demands on the recipient in exchange for the recipient's right
to use and/or redistribute the code.  For example, some projects want
their name and reputation to be transmitted along with the code, and
this is worth imposing the extra burden of a credit or trademark
clause; depending on its onerousness, that burden may result in some
users choosing a package with a less demanding license.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The GPL and License Compatibility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="license-compatibility"></a>The GPL and License Compatibility</h2></div></div></div><p>By far the sharpest dividing line in licensing is that between
proprietary-incompatible and proprietary-compatible licenses, that is,
between the GNU General Public License and everything else.  Because
the primary goal of the GPL's authors is the promotion of free
software, they deliberately crafted the license to make it impossible
to mix GPLed code into proprietary programs.  Specifically, among the
GPL's requirements (see
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html" target="_top">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html</a> for its
full text) are these two:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Any derivative work&#8212;that is, any work
            containing a nontrivial amount of GPLed code&#8212;must
            itself be distributed under the GPL.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>No additional restrictions may be placed on the
            redistribution of either the original work or a derivative
            work.  (The exact language is: "You may not impose any
            further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
            rights granted herein.")</p></li></ol></div><p>With these conditions, the GPL succeeds in making freedom
contagious.  Once a program is copyrighted under the GPL, its terms of
redistribution are <em class="firstterm">viral</em>&#8212;they are passed
on to anything else the code gets incorporated into, making it
effectively impossible to use GPLed code in closed-source programs.
However, these same clauses also make the GPL incompatible with
certain other free licenses.  The usual way this happens is that the
other license imposes a requirement&#8212;for example, a credit clause
requiring the original authors to be mentioned in some way&#8212;that
is incompatible with the GPL's "You may not impose any further
restrictions..." language.  From the point of view of the Free
Software Foundation, these second-order consequences are desirable, or
at least not regrettable.  The GPL not only keeps your software free,
but effectively makes your software an agent in pushing
<span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> software to enforce freedom as well.</p><p>The question of whether or not this is a good way to
promote free software is one of the most persistent holy wars on the
Internet (see <a class="xref" href="#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">&#8222;Avoid Holy Wars&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>), and we won't
investigate it here.  What's important for our purposes is that
GPL compatibility is an important issue when choosing a license.  The
GPL is by far the most popular open source license; at <a class="ulink" href="http://freshmeat.net/stats/#license" target="_top">http://freshmeat.net/stats/#license</a>, it is at 68%, and the
next highest license is at 6%.  If you want your code to be able to be
mixed freely with GPLed code&#8212;and there's a lot of GPLed code out
there&#8212;then you should pick a GPL-compatible license.  Most of
the GPL-compatible open source licenses are also
proprietary-compatible: that is, code under such a license can be used
in a GPLed program, and it can be used in a proprietary program.  Of
course, the <span class="emphasis"><em>results</em></span> of these mixings would not be
compatible with each other, since one would be under the GPL and the
other would be under a closed-source license.  But that concern
applies only to the derivative works, not to the code you distribute
in the first place.</p><p>Fortunately, the Free Software Foundation maintains a list
showing which licenses are compatible with the GPL and which are not,
at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html</a>.  All
of the licenses discussed in this chapter are present on that list, on
one side or the other.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Choosing a License"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="license-choosing"></a>Choosing a License</h2></div></div></div><p>When choosing a license to apply to your project, if at all
possible use an existing license instead of making up a new one.
There are two reasons why existing licenses are better:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>Familiarity.  If you use one of the three or four
            most popular licenses, people won't feel they have to read
            the legalese in order to use your code, because they'll
            have already done so for that license a long time ago.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Quality.  Unless you have a team of lawyers at your
            disposal, you are unlikely to come up with a legally solid
            license.  The licenses mentioned here are the products of
            much thought and experience; unless your project has truly
            unusual needs, it is unlikely you would do better.</p></li></ul></div><p>To apply one of these licenses to your project, see

Window System code).  This license's basic message is "You are free to
use this code however you want."  It is compatible with the GNU GPL,

proprietary programs, or if you at least don't care whether or not it
can be used in proprietary programs, choose the GNU General Public
License
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html" target="_top">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html</a>).  The
GPL is probably the most widely-used free software license in the
world today; this instant recognizability is itself one of the GPL's
major advantages.</p><p>When writing a code library that is meant mainly to be used as
part of other programs, consider carefully whether the restrictions
imposed by the GPL are in line with your project's goals.  In some
cases&#8212;for example, when you're trying to unseat a competing,
proprietary library that does the same thing&#8212;it may make more
strategic sense to license your code in such a way that it can be
mixed into proprietary programs, even though you would otherwise not
wish this.  The Free Software Foundation even fashioned an alternative
to the GPL for such circumstances: the <em class="firstterm">GNU Library
GPL</em>, later renamed to the <em class="firstterm">GNU Lesser
GPL</em> (most people just use the acronym
<em class="firstterm">LGPL</em>, in any case).  The LGPL has looser
restrictions than the GPL, and can be mixed more easily with non-free
code.  However, it's also a bit complex and takes some time to
understand, so if you're not going to use the GPL, I recommend just
using the MIT/X-style license.</p><div class="sect3" title="Is the GPL free or not free?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="is-the-gpl-free"></a>Is the GPL free or not free?</h4></div></div></div><p>One consequence of choosing the GPL is the
possibility&#8212;small, but not infinitely small&#8212;of finding
yourself or your project embroiled in a dispute about whether or not
the GPL is truly "free", given that it places some restrictions on
what you can do with the code&#8212;namely, the restriction that the
code cannot be distributed under any other license.  For some people,
the existence of this restriction means the GPL is "less free" than
more permissive licenses such as the MIT/X license.  Where this
argument usually goes, of course, is that since "more free" must be
better than "less free" (after all, who's not in favor of freedom?),
it follows that those licenses are better than the GPL.</p><p>This debate is another popular holy war (see
<a class="xref" href="#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">&#8222;Avoid Holy Wars&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="#communications" title="Rozdzia&#322; 6. Communications">Rozdzia&#322; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>).  Avoid participating
in it, at least in project forums.  Don't attempt to prove that the
GPL is less free, as free, or more free than other licenses.  Instead,
emphasize the specific reasons your project chose the GPL.  If the
recognizability of license was a reason, say that.  If the enforcement
of a free license on derivative works was also a reason, say that too,
but refuse to be drawn into discussion about whether this makes the
code more or less "free".  Freedom is a complex topic, and there is
little point talking about it if terminology is going to be used as a
stalking horse for substance.</p><p>Since this is a book and not a mailing list thread, however, I
will admit that I've never understood the "GPL is not free" argument.
The only restriction the GPL imposes is that it prevents people from
imposing <span class="emphasis"><em>further</em></span> restrictions.  To say that this
results in less freedom has always seemed to me like saying that
outlawing slavery reduces freedom, because it prevents some people
from owning slaves.</p><p>(Oh, and if you do get drawn into a debate about it, don't raise
the stakes by making inflammatory analogies.)</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="What About The BSD License?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="license-bsd"></a>What About The BSD License?</h3></div></div></div><p>A fair amount of open source software is distributed under
a <em class="firstterm">BSD license</em> (or sometimes
a <em class="firstterm">BSD-style license</em>).  The original BSD license
was used for the Berkeley Software Distribution, in which the
University of California released important portions of a Unix
implementation.  This license (the exact text may be seen in section
2.2.2 of
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#6" target="_top">http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#6</a>) was
similar in spirit to the MIT/X license, except for one
clause:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>All advertising materials mentioning features or use
of this software must display the following acknowledgement: This
product includes software developed by the University of California,
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The presence of that clause not only made the original BSD
license GPL-incompatible, it also set a dangerous precedent: as other
organizations put similar advertising clauses into
<span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> free software&#8212;substituting their own
organization's name in place of "the University of California,
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory"&#8212;software redistributors faced an
ever-increasing burden in what they were required to display.
Fortunately, many of the projects that used this license became aware
of the problem, and simply dropped the advertising clause.  In 1999,
even the University of California did so.</p><p>The result is the revised BSD license, which is simply the
original BSD license with the advertising clause removed.  However,
this history makes the phrase "BSD license" a bit ambiguous: does it
refer to the original, or the revised version?  This is why I prefer
the MIT/X license, which is essentially equivalent, and which does not
suffer from any ambiguity.  However, there is perhaps one reason to
prefer the revised BSD license to the MIT/X license, which is that the
BSD includes this clause:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Neither the name of the &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; nor the
names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products
derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>It's not clear that without such a clause, a recipient of the
software would have had the right to use the licensor's name anyway,
but the clause removes any possible doubt.  For organizations worried
about trademark control, therefore, the revised BSD license may be
slightly preferable to MIT/X.  In general, however, a liberal
copyright license does not imply that recipients have any right to use
or dilute your trademarks &#8212; copyright law and trademark law are
two different beasts.</p><p>If you wish to use the revised BSD license, a template is
available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php" target="_top">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</a>.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Copyright Assignment and Ownership"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="copyright-assignment"></a>Copyright Assignment and Ownership</h2></div></div></div><p>There are three ways to handle copyright ownership of free code
contributed to by many people.  The first is to ignore the issue of
copyright entirely (I don't recommend this).  The second is to collect
a <em class="firstterm">contributor license agreement</em>
(<em class="firstterm">CLA</em>) from each person who works on the
project, explicitly granting the project the right to use that
person's code.  This is usually enough for most projects, and the nice
thing is that in some jurisdictions, CLAs can be sent in by email.
The third way is to get actual copyright assignments from
contributors, so that the project (i.e., some legal entity, usually a
nonprofit) is the copyright owner for everything.  This is the most
legally airtight way, but it's also the most burdensome for
contributors; only a few projects insist on it.</p><p>Note that even under centralized copyright ownership, the code
remains free, because open source licenses do not give the copyright
holder the right to retroactively proprietize all copies of the code.
So even if the project, as a legal entity, were to suddenly turn
around and started distributing all the code under a restrictive
license, that wouldn't cause a problem for the public community.  The
other developers would simply start a fork based on the latest free
copy of the code, and continue as if nothing had happened.  Because
they know they can do this, most contributors cooperate when asked to
sign a CLA or an assignment of copyright.</p><div class="sect2" title="Doing Nothing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="copyright-assignment-none"></a>Doing Nothing</h3></div></div></div><p>Most projects never collect CLAs or copyright assignments from
their contributors.  Instead, they accept code whenever it seems
reasonably clear that the contributor intended it to be incorporated
into the project.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this is okay.  But every now and
then, someone may decide to sue for copyright infringement, alleging
that they are the true owner of the code in question and that they
never agreed to its being distributed by the project under an open
source license.  For example, the SCO Group did something like this to
the Linux project, see
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies</a>
for details.  When this happens, the project will have no
documentation showing that the contributor formally granted the right
to use the code, which could make some legal defenses more
difficult.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Contributor License Agreements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="copyright-assignment-cla"></a>Contributor License Agreements</h3></div></div></div><p>CLAs probably offer the best tradeoff between safety and
convenience.  A CLA is typically an electronic form that a developer
fills out and sends in to the project.  In many jurisdictions, email
submission is enough.  A secure digital signature may or may not be
required; consult a lawyer to find out what method would be best for
your project.</p><p>Most projects use two slightly different CLAs, one for
individuals, and one for corporate contributors.  But in both types,
the core language is the same: the contributor grants the
project <span class="emphasis"><em>"...perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare

but if you get all those adjectives into it, you're probably
fine.</p><p>When you request CLAs from contributors, make sure to emphasize
that you are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> asking for actual copyright
assignment.  In fact, many CLAs start out by reminding the reader of
this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This is a license agreement only; it does not transfer

project copyright ownership on her contributions.  Ideally, this is
done on paper and either faxed or snail-mailed to the project.</p><p>Some projects insist on full assignment because having a single
legal entity own the copyright on the entire code base can be useful
if the terms of the open source license ever need to be enforced in
court.  If no single entity has the right to do it, all the
contributors might have to cooperate, but some might not have time or
even be reachable when the issue arises.</p><p>Different organizations apply different amounts of rigor to the
task of collecting assignments.  Some simply get an informal statement
from a contributor on a public list mailing list&#8212;something to
the effect of "I hereby assign copyright in this code to the project,
to be licensed under the same terms as the rest of the code."  At
least one lawyer I've talked to says that's really enough, presumably
because it happens in a context where copyright assignment is normal
and expected anyway, and because it represents a <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">bona
fide</em></span> effort on the project's part to ascertain the
developer's true intentions.  On the other hand, the Free Software
Foundation goes to the opposite extreme: they require contributors to
physically sign and mail in a piece of paper containing a formal
statement of copyright assignment, sometimes for just one
contribution, sometimes for current and future contributions.  If the
developer is employed, the FSF asks that the employer sign it
too.</p><p>The FSF's paranoia is understandable.  If someone violates the
terms of the GPL by incorporating some of their software into a
proprietary program, the FSF will need to fight that in court, and
they want their copyrights to be as airtight as possible when that
happens.  Since the FSF is copyright holder for a lot of popular
software, they view this as a real possibility.  Whether your
organization needs to be similarly scrupulous is something only you
can decide, in consultation with lawyers.  In general, unless there's
some specific reason why your project needs full copyright assignment,
just go with CLAs; they're easier for everyone.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Dual Licensing Schemes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dual-licensing"></a>Dual Licensing Schemes</h2></div></div></div><p>Some projects try to fund themselves by using a dual licensing
scheme, in which proprietary derivative works may pay the copyright
holder for the right to use the code, but the code still remains free
for use by open source projects.  This tends to work better with code
libraries than with standalone applications, naturally.  The exact
terms differ from case to case.  Often the license for the free side
is the GNU GPL, since it already bars others from incorporating the
covered code into their proprietary product without permission from
the copyright holder, but sometimes it is a custom license that has
the same effect.  An example of the former is the MySQL license,
described at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/" target="_top">http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/</a>; an
example of the latter is Sleepycat Software's licensing strategy,
described at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.sleepycat.com/download/licensinginfo.shtml" target="_top">http://www.sleepycat.com/download/licensinginfo.shtml</a>.</p><p>You might be wondering: how can the copyright holder offer
proprietary licensing for a mandatory fee if the terms of the GNU GPL
stipulate that the code must be available under less restrictive
terms?  The answer is that the GPL's terms are something the copyright
holder imposes on everyone else; the owner is therefore free to
decide <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to apply those terms to itself.  A
good way to think of it is to imagine that the copyright owner has an
infinite number of copies of the software stored in a bucket.  Each
time it takes one out of the bucket to send into the world, it can
decide what license to put on it: GPL, proprietary, or something else.
Its right to do this is not tied to the GPL or any other open source
license; it is simply a power granted by copyright law.</p><p>The attractiveness of dual licensing is that, at its best, it
provides a way for a free software project to get a reliable income
stream.  Unfortunately, it can also interfere with the normal dynamics
of open source projects.  The problem is that any volunteer who makes
a code contribution is now contributing to two distinct entities: the
free version of the code and the proprietary version.  While the
contributor will be comfortable contributing to the free version,
since that's the norm in open source projects, she may feel funny
about contributing to someone else's semi-proprietary revenue stream.
The awkwardness is exacerbated by the fact that in dual licensing, the
copyright owner really needs to gather formal, signed copyright
assignments from all contributors, in order to protect itself from a
disgruntled contributor later claiming a percentage of royalties from
the proprietary stream.  The process of collecting these assignment
papers means that contributors are starkly confronted with the fact
that they are doing work that makes money for someone else.</p><p>Not all volunteers will be bothered by this; after all, their
contributions go into the open source edition as well, and that may be
where their main interest lies.  Nevertheless, dual licensing is an
instance of the copyright holder assigning itself a special right that
others in the project do not have, and is thus bound to raise
tensions at some point, at least with some volunteers.</p><p>What seems to happen in practice is that companies based on
dual licensed software do not have truly egalitarian development
communities.  They get small-scale bug fixes and cleanup patches from
external sources, but end up doing most of the hard work with internal
resources.  For example, Zack Urlocker, vice president of marketing at
MySQL, told me that the company generally ends up hiring the most
active volunteers anyway.  Thus, although the product itself is open
source, licensed under the GPL, its development is more or less
controlled by the company, albeit with the (extremely unlikely)
possibility that someone truly dissatisfied with the company's
handling of the software could fork the project.  To what degree this
threat preëmptively shapes the company's policies I don't know,
but at any rate, MySQL does not seem to be having acceptance problems
either in the open source world or beyond.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Patents"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="patents"></a>Patents</h2></div></div></div><p>Software patents are the lightning rod issue of the moment in
free software, because they pose the only real threat against which
the free software community cannot defend itself.  Copyright and
trademark problems can always be gotten around.  If part of your code
looks like it may infringe on someone else's copyright, you can just
rewrite that part.  If it turns out someone has a trademark on your
project's name, at the very worst you can just rename the project.
Although changing names would be a temporary inconvenience, it
wouldn't matter in the long run, since the code itself would still do
what it always did.</p><p>But a patent is a blanket injunction against implementing a
certain idea.  It doesn't matter who writes the code, nor even what
programming language is used.  Once someone has accused a free
software project of infringing a patent, the project must either stop
implementing that particular feature, or face an expensive and
time-consuming lawsuit.  Since the instigators of such lawsuits are
usually corporations with deep pockets&#8212;that's who has the
resources and inclination to acquire patents in the first
place&#8212;most free software projects cannot afford the latter
possibility, and must capitulate immediately even if they think it
highly likely that the patent would be unenforceable in court.  To
avoid getting into such a situation in the first place, free software
projects are starting to code defensively, avoiding patented
algorithms in advance even when they are the best or only available
solution to a programming problem.<sup>[<a name="idp9875568" href="#ftn.idp9875568" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup></p><p>Surveys and anecdotal evidence show that not only the vast
majority of open source programmers, but a majority
of <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> programmers, think that software patents
should be abolished entirely.<sup>[<a name="idp9877936" href="#ftn.idp9877936" class="footnote">29</a>]</sup> Open source programmers tend to feel
particularly strongly about it, and may refuse to work on projects
that are too closely associated with the collection or enforcement of
software patents.  If your organization collects software patents,
then make it clear, in a public and irrevocable way, that the patents
would never be enforced on open source projects, and that they are
only to be used as a defense in case some other party initiates an
infringement suit against your organization.  This is not only the
right thing to do, it's also good open source public relations.<sup>[<a name="idp9880144" href="#ftn.idp9880144" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup></p><p>Unfortunately, collecting patents for defensive purposes is a
rational action.  The current patent system, at least in the United
States, is by its nature an arms race: if your competitors have
acquired a lot of patents, then your best defense is to acquire a lot
of patents yourself, so that if you're ever hit with a patent
infringement suit you can respond with a similar threat&#8212;then the
two parties usually sit down and work out a cross-licensing deal so
that neither of them has to pay anything, except to their intellectual
property lawyers of course.</p><p>The harm done to free software by software patents is more
insidious than just direct threats to code development, however.
Software patents encourage an atmosphere of secrecy among firmware
designers, who justifiably worry that by publishing details of their
interfaces they will be giving technical help to competitors seeking
to slap them with patent infringement suits.  This is not just a
theoretical danger; it has apparently been happening for a long time
in the video card industry, for example.  Many video card
manufacturers are reluctant to release the detailed programming
specifications needed to produce high-performance open source drivers
for their cards, thus making it impossible for free operating systems
to support those cards to their full potential.  Why would the
manufacturers do this?  It doesn't make sense for them to
work <span class="emphasis"><em>against</em></span> software support; after all,
compatibility with more operating systems can only mean more card
sales.  But it turns out that, behind the design room door, these
shops are all violating one another's patents, sometimes knowingly and
sometimes accidentally.  The patents are so unpredictable and so
potentially broad that no card manufacturer can ever be certain it's
safe, even after doing a patent search.  Thus, manufacturers dare not
publish their full interface specifications, since that would make it
much easier for competitors to figure out whether any patents are
being infringed.  (Of course, the nature of this situation is such
that you will not find a written admission from a primary source that
it is going on; I learned it through a personal communication.)</p><p>Some free software licenses have special clauses to combat, or at
least discourage, software patents.  The GNU GPL, for example, contains
this language:</p><pre class="screen">
  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

[...]

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
</pre><p>The Apache License, Version 2.0
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_top">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a>) also
contains anti-patent requirements.  First, it stipulates that anyone
distributing code under the license must implicitly include a
royalty-free patent license for any patents they might hold that could
apply to the code.  Second, and most ingeniously, it punishes anyone
who initiates a patent infringement claim on the covered work, by
automatically terminating their implicit patent license the moment
such a claim is made:</p><pre class="screen">
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except
as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use,
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)
alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent
litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated
within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
is filed.
</pre><p>Although it is useful, both legally and politically, to build
patent defenses into free software licenses this way, in the end these
steps will not be enough to dispel the chilling effect that the threat
of patent lawsuits has on free software.  Only changes in the
substance or interpretation of international patent law will do that.

hardware development, checking their hardware description language

complaints with a grain of salt&#8212;many of the trackers below are

environment which is familiar and easily accessible to most people,
the DBTS is good for handling high volumes of incoming reports that

of course.  Developers must invest the time needed to learn the email
command system, and users must write their bug reports without a
web form to guide them in choosing what information to write.  There
are tools available to help users send better bug reports, such as the

[bcc'ed to committers, hackers]

My last pamphlet was sufficiently well received that I was not
scared away from sending another one, and today I have the time
and inclination to do so.

I've had a little trouble with deciding on the right distribution
of this kind of stuff, this time it is bcc'ed to committers and
hackers, that is probably the best I can do.  I'm not subscribed
to hackers myself but more on that later.

The thing which have triggered me this time is the "sleep(1) should
do fractional seconds" thread, which have pestered our lives for
many days now, it's probably already a couple of weeks, I can't
even be bothered to check.

To those of you who have missed this particular thread: Congratulations.

It was a proposal to make sleep(1) DTRT if given a non-integer
argument that set this particular grass-fire off.  I'm not going
to say anymore about it than that, because it is a much smaller
item than one would expect from the length of the thread, and it
has already received far more attention than some of the *problems*
we have around here.

The sleep(1) saga is the most blatant example of a bike shed
discussion we have had ever in FreeBSD.  The proposal was well
thought out, we would gain compatibility with OpenBSD and NetBSD,
and still be fully compatible with any code anyone ever wrote.

Yet so many objections, proposals and changes were raised and
launched that one would think the change would have plugged all
the holes in swiss cheese or changed the taste of Coca Cola or
something similar serious.

"What is it about this bike shed ?" Some of you have asked me.

It's a long story, or rather it's an old story, but it is quite
short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote a book in the early
1960'ies, called "Parkinson's Law", which contains a lot of insight
into the dynamics of management.

You can find it on Amazon, and maybe also in your dads book-shelf,
it is well worth its price and the time to read it either way,
if you like Dilbert, you'll like Parkinson.

Somebody recently told me that he had read it and found that only
about 50% of it applied these days.  That is pretty darn good I
would say, many of the modern management books have hit-rates a
lot lower than that, and this one is 35+ years old.

In the specific example involving the bike shed, the other vital
component is an atomic power-plant, I guess that illustrates the
age of the book.

Parkinson shows how you can go in to the board of directors and
get approval for building a multi-million or even billion dollar
atomic power plant, but if you want to build a bike shed you will
be tangled up in endless discussions.

Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic plant is so vast,
so expensive and so complicated that people cannot grasp it, and
rather than try, they fall back on the assumption that somebody
else checked all the details before it got this far.   Richard P.
Feynmann gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point,
examples relating to Los Alamos in his books.

A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one of those over
a weekend, and still have time to watch the game on TV.  So no
matter how well prepared, no matter how reasonable you are with
your proposal, somebody will seize the chance to show that he is
doing his job, that he is paying attention, that he is *here*.

In Denmark we call it "setting your fingerprint".  It is about
personal pride and prestige, it is about being able to point
somewhere and say "There!  *I* did that."  It is a strong trait in
politicians, but present in most people given the chance.  Just
think about footsteps in wet cement.

I bow my head in respect to the original proposer because he stuck
to his guns through this carpet blanking from the peanut gallery,
and the change is in our tree today.  I would have turned my back
and walked away after less than a handful of messages in that
thread.

And that brings me, as I promised earlier, to why I am not subscribed
to -hackers:

I un-subscribed from -hackers several years ago, because I could
not keep up with the email load.  Since then I have dropped off
several other lists as well for the very same reason.

And I still get a lot of email.  A lot of it gets routed to /dev/null
by filters:  People like [omitted] will never make it onto my
screen, commits to documents in languages I don't understand
likewise, commits to ports as such.  All these things and more go
the winter way without me ever even knowing about it.

But despite these sharp teeth under my mailbox I still get too much
email.

This is where the greener grass comes into the picture:

I wish we could reduce the amount of noise in our lists and I wish
we could let people build a bike shed every so often, and I don't
really care what colour they paint it.

The first of these wishes is about being civil, sensitive and 
intelligent in our use of email.

If I could concisely and precisely define a set of criteria for
when one should and when one should not reply to an email so that
everybody would agree and abide by it, I would be a happy man, but
I am too wise to even attempt that.

But let me suggest a few pop-up windows I would like to see
mail-programs implement whenever people send or reply to email
to the lists they want me to subscribe to:

The second part of my wish is more emotional.  Obviously, the
capacities we had manning the unfriendly fire in the sleep(1)
thread, despite their many years with the project, never cared
enough to do this tiny deed, so why are they suddenly so enflamed
by somebody else so much their junior doing it ?

I wish I knew.

I do know that reasoning will have no power to stop such "reactionaire
conservatism".  It may be that these people are frustrated about
their own lack of tangible contribution lately or it may be a bad
case of "we're old and grumpy, WE know how youth should behave".

Either way it is very unproductive for the project, but I have no
suggestions for how to stop it.  The best I can suggest is to refrain
from fuelling the monsters that lurk in the mailing lists:  Ignore
them, don't answer them, forget they're there.

I hope we can get a stronger and broader base of contributors in
FreeBSD, and I hope we together can prevent the grumpy old men
and the [omitted]s of the world from chewing them up, spitting
them out and scaring them away before they ever get a leg to the 
ground.

For the people who have been lurking out there, scared away from
participating by the gargoyles:  I can only apologise and encourage
you to try anyway, this is not the way I want the environment in
the project to be.

                       Reporting Bugs in Subversion

This document tells how and where to report bugs. (It is not a list of
all outstanding bugs &#8212; you can get that here instead.)

Where To Report A Bug
---------------------

    * If the bug is in Subversion itself, send mail to
      users@subversion.tigris.org. Once it's confirmed as a bug,
      someone, possibly you, can enter it into the issue tracker. (Or
      if you're pretty sure about the bug, go ahead and post directly
      to our development list, dev@subversion.tigris.org. But if
      you're not sure, it's better to post to users@ first; someone
      there can tell you whether the behavior you encountered is
      expected or not.)

    * If the bug is in the APR library, please report it to both of
      these mailing lists: dev@apr.apache.org, dev@subversion.tigris.org.

    * If the bug is in the Neon HTTP library, please report it to:
      neon@webdav.org, dev@subversion.tigris.org.

    * If the bug is in Apache HTTPD 2.0, please report it to both of
      these mailing lists: dev@httpd.apache.org,
      dev@subversion.tigris.org. The Apache httpd developer mailing
      list is high-traffic, so your bug report post has the
      possibility to be overlooked. You may also file a bug report at
      http://httpd.apache.org/bug_report.html.

    * If the bug is in your rug, please give it a hug and keep it snug.

How To Report A Bug
-------------------

First, make sure it's a bug. If Subversion does not behave the way you
expect, look in the documentation and mailing list archives for
evidence that it should behave the way you expect. Of course, if it's
a common-sense thing, like Subversion just destroyed your data and
caused smoke to pour out of your monitor, then you can trust your
judgement. But if you're not sure, go ahead and ask on the users
mailing list first, users@subversion.tigris.org, or ask in IRC,
irc.freenode.net, channel #svn.

Once you've established that it's a bug, the most important thing you
can do is come up with a simple description and reproduction
recipe. For example, if the bug, as you initially found it, involves
five files over ten commits, try to make it happen with just one file
and one commit. The simpler the reproduction recipe, the more likely a
developer is to successfully reproduce the bug and fix it.

When you write up the reproduction recipe, don't just write a prose
description of what you did to make the bug happen. Instead, give a
literal transcript of the exact series of commands you ran, and their
output. Use cut-and-paste to do this. If there are files involved, be
sure to include the names of the files, and even their content if you
think it might be relevant. The very best thing is to package your
reproduction recipe as a script, that helps us a lot.

<span class="emphasis"><em>Quick sanity check: you *are* running the most recent version of
Subversion, right? :-) Possibly the bug has already been fixed; you
should test your reproduction recipe against the most recent
Subversion development tree.</em></span>

In addition to the reproduction recipe, we'll also need a complete
description of the environment in which you reproduced the bug. That
means:

    * Your operating system
    * The release and/or revision of Subversion
    * The compiler and configuration options you built Subversion with
    * Any private modifications you made to your Subversion
    * The version of Berkeley DB you're running Subversion with, if any
    * Anything else that could possibly be relevant. Err on the side
      of too much information, rather than too little.

Once you have all this, you're ready to write the report. Start out
with a clear description of what the bug is. That is, say how you
expected Subversion to behave, and contrast that with how it actually
behaved. While the bug may seem obvious to you, it may not be so
obvious to someone else, so it's best to avoid a guessing game. Follow
that with the environment description, and the reproduction recipe. If
you also want to include speculation as to the cause, and even a patch
to fix the bug, that's great &#8212; see
http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/#patches for
instructions on sending patches.

Post all of this information to dev@subversion.tigris.org, or if you
have already been there and been asked to file an issue, then go to
the Issue Tracker and follow the instructions there.

Thanks. We know it's a lot of work to file an effective bug report,
but a good report can save hours of a developer's time, and make the
bug much more likely to get fixed.

THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

1. Definitions

   a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
      and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
      derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
      literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and
      includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which
      the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any
      form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
      that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of
      doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
      phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
      Adaptation for the purpose of this License.

   b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
      such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances,
      phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other
      than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the
      selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute
      intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its
      entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other
      contributions, each constituting separate and independent works
      in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective
      whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
      considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of
      this License.

      listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has
      been approved by Creative Commons as being essentially
      equivalent to this License, including, at a minimum, because
      that license: (i) contains terms that have the same purpose,
      meaning and effect as the License Elements of this License; and,
      (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing of adaptations of works
      made available under that license under this License or a
      Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same License
      Elements as this License.

      folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the
      person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
      performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of
      broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.

   h. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
      terms of this License including without limitation any
      production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain,
      whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including
      digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a
      lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a
      dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or

2. Fair Dealing Rights.

   Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict
   any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or
   exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright
   protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.

3. License Grant.

   Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor
   hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
   exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

   a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
      Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
      Collections;

   b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
      Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
      reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
      identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
      example, a translation could be marked "The original work was
      translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
      indicate "The original work has been modified.";

   c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
      incorporated in Collections; and,

   d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.

   e. For the avoidance of doubt:

         i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme
            cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive
            right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
            the rights granted under this License;

        ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
            jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties
            through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can
            be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to
            collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the
            rights granted under this License; and,

       iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
            to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the
            event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
            society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
            that society, from any exercise by You of the rights
            granted under this License.

   The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
   now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
   to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
   the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
   rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.

4. Restrictions. 

   The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
   and limited by the following restrictions:

   a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
      terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
      Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
      copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not
      offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of
      this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
      exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
      the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
      intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
      disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
      Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
      measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of
      the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
      recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
      applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this
      does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
      made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
      Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
      required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
      Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
      extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
      required by Section 4(c), as requested.

   b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under
      the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this
      License with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a
      Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later
      license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
      License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative
      Commons Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under
      one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the
      terms of that license. If you license the Adaptation under the
      terms of any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii)
      (the "Applicable License"), you must comply with the terms of
      the Applicable License generally and the following provisions:
      (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for, the Applicable
      License with every copy of each Adaptation You Distribute or
      Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on
      the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable License
      or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
      the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
      Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
      refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of
      warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
      Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation, You may not
      impose any effective technological measures on the Adaptation
      that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from
      You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
      terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to
      the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
      not require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to
      be made subject to the terms of the Applicable License.

   c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
      Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
      made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
      for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You
      are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
      pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original
      Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g.,
      a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
      ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
      service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
      parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
      extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
      specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does
      not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
      the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case
      of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in
      the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
      Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
      Original Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may
      be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that
      in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such
      credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of
      the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
      credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for
      the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You
      may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose
      of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
      Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or
      explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
      endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
      Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without
      the separate, express prior written permission of the Original
      Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

   d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
      be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
      Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
      part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
      mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
      the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
      (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in
      Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations)
      would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
      other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's
      honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as
      appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by
      the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
      exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to
      make Adaptations) but not otherwise.

5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer

UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

6. Limitation on Liability.

EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

7. Termination

   a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
      License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations
      or Collections from You under this License, however, will not
      have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or
      entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
      1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
      License.

   b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
      here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
      in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
      right to release the Work under different license terms or to
      stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
      any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or
      any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
      under the terms of this License), and this License will continue
      in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

8. Miscellaneous

   a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
      Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
      the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted
      to You under this License.

   b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
      Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
      on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
      under this License.

   c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
      under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
      enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License,
      and without further action by the parties to this agreement,
      such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary
      to make such provision valid and enforceable.

   d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
      no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
      writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
      or consent.

   e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
      parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
      understandings, agreements or representations with respect to
      the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
      additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
      You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
      agreement of the Licensor and You.

   f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
      this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
      Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
      amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
      WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
      Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention
      (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter
      take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License
      terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding
      provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in
      the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights
      granted under applicable copyright law includes additional
      rights not granted under this License, such additional rights
      are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not
      intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable
      law.
