existing license instead of making up a new one.  And don't just use
any existing license — use one of the widely-used,
well-recognized existing licenses.</p><p>Such licenses are familiar to many people already.  If you use
one of them, people won't feel they have to read the legalese in order
to use your code, because they'll have already done so for that
license a long time ago.  Thus, you reduce or remove one possible
barrier to entry for your project.  They are also of a high quality:
they are the products of much thought and experience; indeed most
of them are revisions of previous versions of themselves, and the
modern versions represent a great deal of accumulated legal and
technical wisdom.  Unless your project has truly unusual needs, it is
unlikely you could do better, even with a team of lawyers at your
disposal.</p><p>Below is a list of licenses that in my opinion meets these
criteria; in parentheses are the standard formal abbreviation for the
license and an authoritative URL for its full text.  This list is not
in order of preference, but rather in roughly descending order from
strong copyleft at the top to completely non-copyleft at the bottom.
The exact provisions of each license differ in various interesting
ways (except for MIT and BSD, which differ only in uninteresting
ways), and there isn't space here to explore all the possible
ramifications of each for your project.  However, many good
discussions of that sort are available on the Internet; in particular
the Wikipedia pages for these licenses generally give good
overviews.</p><p>If you have nothing else to guide you and you want a copyleft
license, then choose either the GPL-3.0 or the
AGPL-3.0 — the difference between them will be
discussed below — and if you want a non-copyleft
license, choose the MIT license.  I've put those licenses in boldface
to reflect this:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="bold"><strong>GNU General Public License version 3</strong></span> (<code class="code">GPL-3.0</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>)</li><li class="listitem"><span class="bold"><strong>GNU Affero General Public License version 3</strong></span> (<code class="code">AGPL-3.0</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html</a>)</li><li class="listitem">Mozilla Public License 2.0 (<code class="code">MPL-2.0</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">https://www.mozilla.org/MPL/</a>)</li><li class="listitem">GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License version 3 (<code class="code">LGPL-3.0</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a>)</li><li class="listitem">Eclipse Public License 1.0 (<code class="code">EPL-1.0</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html">https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html</a>) <span class="emphasis"><em>(Note that version 2 of the EPL was almost ready as of mid-2014, and may be out by the time you read this.)</em></span></li><li class="listitem"><span class="bold"><strong>MIT license</strong></span> (<code class="code">MIT</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a>)</li><li class="listitem">Apache License 2.0 (<code class="code">Apache-2.0</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0</a>)</li><li class="listitem">BSD 2-Clause ("Simplified" or "FreeBSD") license (<code class="code">BSD-2-Clause</code>, <a class="ulink" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause">https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause</a>)</li></ul></div><p>Note that there are some arguments for choosing the Apache
License 2.0 as a default non-copyleft license, and they are nearly as
compelling as those for choosing MIT.  In the end, I come down in
favor of MIT because it is extremely short, and both widely used and
widely recognized<sup>[<a id="idm4221" href="#ftn.idm4221" class="footnote">100</a>]</sup>.  While the
Apache License 2.0 has the advantage of containing some explicit
defenses against misuse of software patents, which might be important
to your organization depending on the kind of project you're
launching, the MIT license is fully compatible with all versions of
the GNU General Public License, meaning that you can distributed,
under any version of the GPL, mixed-provenance works that contain
MIT-licensed code.  The GPL-compatibility situation for the Apache
License, on the other hand, is more complicated — by
some interpretations, it is compatible with GPL version 3 only.
Therefore, to avoid giving your downstream redistributors the headache
of having to read sentences like the preceding ones, I just recommend
the MIT license as the default non-copyleft license for anyone who
doesn't have a reason to choose otherwise.</p><p>The mechanics of applying a license to your project are

proprietary programs, or if you at least don't care whether or not it
can be used in proprietary programs, the GNU General Public License is
a good choice.</p><p>When writing a code library that is meant mainly to be used as
part of other programs, consider carefully whether the restrictions
imposed by the GPL are in line with your project's goals.  In some
cases — for example, when you're trying to unseat a competing,
proprietary library that offers the same functionality — it may
make more strategic sense to license your code in such a way that it
can be mixed into proprietary programs, even though you would
otherwise not wish this.  The Free Software Foundation even fashioned
an alternative to the GPL for such circumstances: the <em class="firstterm">GNU
Lesser GPL</em><sup>[<a id="idm4233" href="#ftn.idm4233" class="footnote">101</a>]</sup> The LGPL has looser restrictions than the GPL,
and can be mixed more easily with non-free code.  The FSF's page about
the LGPL, <a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html</a>, has a good discussion of when to
use it.</p><div class="sect3" title="The &quot;or any later version&quot; Option: Future-Proofing the GPL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gpl-future-proofing"/>The "or any later version" Option: Future-Proofing the GPL</h3></div></div></div><p>The GPL has a well-known optional recommendation that you
release software under the current version of the GPL while giving
downstream recipients the option to redistribute it under any
<span class="emphasis"><em>later</em></span> (i.e., future) version.  The way to offer
this option is to put language like this in the license headers (see
<a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html#license-quickstart-applying" title="How to Apply a License to Your Software">the section called “How to Apply a License to Your Software”</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started</em></a></span>) of the actual source
files:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This program is free software: you can redistribute it
and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as
published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
License, <span class="bold"><strong>or (at your option) any later
version.</strong></span></em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>(Emphasis added.)</p><p>Whether you want to offer that option depends largely on how
likely you think the Free Software Foundation is to make GPL revisions
that you would approve of.  I think the FSF has done a good job of
that so far, and I generally do include that option when I use the
GPL.  That way I don't have to be responsible for updating the
licenses myself forever — which is good, since I won't
be around forever.  Others can do it, either just to keep the software
license up-to-date with legal developments, or to solve some future
license compatibility problem that couldn't have been anticipated now
(for example, see the compatibility discussion in <a class="xref" href="ch09s04.html#gnu-affero-gpl" title="The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code">the section called “The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code”</a> below).</p><p>Not everyone feels the same way, however; most notably, the
Linux kernel is famously licensed under the GNU GPL version 2
<span class="emphasis"><em>without</em></span> the "or any later version" clause, and
influential kernel copyright holders, especially Linus Torvalds, have
expressed clearly that they do not intend to move its license to
version 3.0.</p><p>This book cannot answer the question of whether you should
include the option or not.  You now know that you have the choice, at
least, and that different people come to different conclusions about
it.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="gnu-affero-gpl"/>The GNU Affero GPL: A Version of the GNU GPL for Server-Side Code</h3></div></div></div><p>In 2007, the Free Software Foundation released a variant of the
GPL called the <em class="firstterm">GNU Affero GPL</em>.  Its purpose was to bring
copyleft-style sharing provisions to the increasing amount of code
being run as hosted services — that is, software that
runs "in the cloud" on remote servers, that users interact with only
over the network, and that therefore is not directly distributed to its
users as executable or source code.  Many such services use GPL'd
software, often with extensive modifications, yet could avoid
publishing their changes because they weren't actually distributing
code.</p><p>The AGPL's solution to this was to take the GPL and add a
"Remote Network Interaction" clause, stating "<span class="emphasis"><em>...if you
modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer all
users interacting with it remotely through a computer network ... an
opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version ... at
no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating
copying of software.</em></span>" This expanded the GPL's enforcement
powers into the new world of application service providers.  The Free
Software Foundation recommends that the GNU AGPL 3.0 be used for any
software that will commonly be run over a network.</p><p>Note that the AGPL-3.0 is not directly compatible with GPL-2.0,
though it is compatible with GPL-3.0.  Since most software licensed
under GPL-2.0 includes the "or any later version" clause anyway, that
software can just be shifted to GPL-3.0 if and when you need to mix it
with AGPL-3.0 code.  However, if you need to mix with programs
licensed strictly under the GPL-2.0 (that is, programs licensed
without the "or any later version" clause), the AGPL3.0 wouldn't be
compatible with that.</p><p>Although the history of the AGPL-3.0 is a bit complicated, the
license itself is simple: it's just the GPL-3.0 with one extra clause
about network interaction.  The Wikipedia article on the AGPL is
excellent: <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License</a></p></div><div class="sect3" title="The Copyright Holder Is Special, Even In Copyleft Licenses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="copyright-holder-is-special"/>The Copyright Holder Is Special, Even In Copyleft Licenses</h3></div></div></div><p>One common misunderstanding is that licensing your software
under the GPL or AGPL requires you to provide source code to anyone
who requests it under the terms of the license.  But that's not quite
how it works.  If you are the <span class="emphasis"><em>sole</em></span> copyright
holder in a piece of software, then you are not bound by the copyright
terms you chose, because (essentially) you can't be forced to sue
yourself for copyright infringement.  You can enforce the terms on
others, but it's up to you to decide whether and when those terms
apply to you.  After all, because you had the software originally, you
never "distributed" it to yourself and thus are not bound by the
redistribution requirements of the license.</p><p>Of course, this only applies to situations where you own the
whole copyright.  If you include others' GPL- or AGPL-licensed code in
your project and then distribute that project, you are not the sole
copyright holder, and so you are as bound by the original terms as
anyone else who uses and redistributes that code, either unmodified or
as part of a derivative work.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Is the GPL Free or Not Free?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="is-the-gpl-free"/>Is the GPL Free or Not Free?</h3></div></div></div><p>One consequence of choosing the GPL (or AGPL) is the
possibility — small, but not infinitely small — of finding
yourself or your project embroiled in a dispute about whether or not
the GPL is truly "free", given that it places some restrictions on
how you redistribute the code — namely, the restriction that the
code cannot be distributed under any other license.  For some people,
the existence of this restriction means the GPL is therefore "less
free" than non-copyleft licenses.  Where this
argument usually goes, of course, is that since "more free" must be
better than "less free" (after all, who's not in favor of freedom?),
it follows that those licenses are better than the GPL.</p><p>This debate is another popular holy war (see
<a class="xref" href="ch06s03.html#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">the section called “Avoid Holy Wars”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <em>Communications</em></a></span>).  Avoid participating
in it, at least in project forums.  Don't attempt to prove that the
GPL is less free, as free, or more free than other licenses.  Instead,
emphasize the specific reasons your project chose the GPL.  If the
recognizability of license was a reason, say that.  If the enforcement
of a free license on derivative works was also a reason, say that too,
but refuse to be drawn into discussion about whether this makes the
code more or less "free".  Freedom is a complex topic, and there is
little point talking about it if terminology is going to be used as a
stalking horse for substance.</p><p>Since this is a book and not a mailing list thread, however, I
will admit that I've never understood the "GPL is not free" argument.
The only restriction the GPL imposes is that it prevents people from
imposing <span class="emphasis"><em>further</em></span> restrictions.  To say that this
results in less freedom has always seemed perverse to me.  If the
retention of monopoly is somehow a freedom to be protected, then the
word "freedom" is no longer meaningful.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm4221" href="#idm4221" class="para">100</a>] </sup>License choice trends for open source
