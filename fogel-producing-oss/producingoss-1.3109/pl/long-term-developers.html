them there long enough that they acquire both technical and political
expertise&#8212;a couple of years, at a minimum.  Of course, no
project, whether open or closed-source, benefits from swapping
programmers in and out too often.  The need for a newcomer to learn
the ropes each time would be a deterrent in any environment.  But the
penalty is even stronger in open source projects, because outgoing
developers take with them not only their knowledge of the code, but
also their status in the community and the human relationships they
have made there.</p><p>The credibility a developer has accumulated cannot be
transferred.  To pick the most obvious example, an incoming developer
can't inherit commit access from an outgoing one (see
<a class="xref" href="money-vs-love.html" title="Money Can't Buy You Love">&#8222;Money Can't Buy You Love&#8221;</a> later in this chapter), so if the
new developer doesn't already have commit access, he will have to
submit patches until he does.  But commit access is only the most
measurable manifestation of lost influence.  A long-time developer
also knows all the old arguments that have been hashed and rehashed on
the discussion lists.  A new developer, having no memory of those
conversations, may try to raise the topics again, leading to a loss of
credibility for your organization; the others might wonder "Can't
they remember anything?"  A new developer will also have no political
feel for the project's personalities, and will not be able to
influence development directions as quickly or as smoothly as one
who's been around a long time.</p><p>Train newcomers through a program of supervised engagement.  The
new developer should be in direct contact with the public development
community from the very first day, starting off with bug fixes and
cleanup tasks, so he can learn the code base and acquire a reputation
in the community, yet not spark any long and involved design
discussions.  All the while, one or more experienced developers should
be available for questioning, and should be reading every post the
newcomer makes to the development lists, even if they're in threads
that the experienced developers normally wouldn't pay attention to.
This will help the group spot potential rocks before the newcomer runs
aground.  Private, behind-the-scenes encouragement and pointers can
also help a lot, especially if the newcomer is not accustomed to
massively parallel peer review of his code.</p><p>When CollabNet hires a new developer to work on Subversion, we
sit down together and pick some open bugs for the new person to cut
his teeth on.  We'll discuss the technical outlines of the solutions,
and then assign at least one experienced developer to (publicly)
review the patch that the new developer will (also publicly) post.  We
typically don't even look at the patch before the main development
list sees it, although we could if there were some reason to.  The
important thing is that the new developer go through the process of
public review, learning the code base while simultaneously becoming
accustomed to receiving critiques from complete strangers.  But we
try to coordinate the timing so that our own review comes immediately
after the posting of the patch.  That way the first review the list
sees is ours, which can help set the tone for the others' reviews.  It
also contributes to the idea that this new person is to be taken
seriously: if others see that we're putting in the time to give
detailed reviews, with thorough explanations and references into the
archives where appropriate, they'll appreciate that a form of training
is going on, and that it probably signifies a long-term investment.
This can make them more positively disposed toward that developer, at
least to the degree of spending a little extra time answering
questions and reviewing patches.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="money.html">Poprzedni</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="money.html">Pocz&#261;tek rozdzia&#322;u</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="appear-as-many.html">Nast&#281;pny</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Rozdzia&#322; 5.
