Getting Started</h1></div></div></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"/><p>The classic model of how free software projects get started was
supplied by Eric Raymond, in a now-famous paper on open source
processes entitled <em class="citetitle">The Cathedral and the
Bazaar</em>.  He wrote:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Every good work of software starts by scratching
      a developer's personal itch.</em></span></p><p>(from <span class="bold"><strong><a class="ulink" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/</a>
      </strong></span>)</p></blockquote></div><p>Note that Raymond wasn't saying that open source projects happen
only when some individual gets an itch.  Rather, he was saying that
<span class="emphasis"><em>good</em></span> software results when the programmer has a
personal interest in seeing the problem solved; the relevance of this
to free software was that a personal itch happened to be the most
frequent motivation for starting a free software project.</p><p>This is still how most free software projects are started, but less so
now than in 1997, when Raymond wrote those words.  Today, we have the
phenomenon of organizations—for-profit corporations,
governments, non-profits, etc—starting large, centrally-conceived
open source
projects from scratch.  The lone programmer, banging out some code to
solve a local problem and then realizing the result has wider
applicability, is still the source of much new free software, but is
not the only story.</p><p>Raymond's point is still insightful, however.  The essential
condition is that the producers of the software have a direct interest
in its success, usually because they use it themselves or work
directly with people who use it.  If the software
doesn't do what it's supposed to do, the person or organization
producing it will feel the dissatisfaction in their daily work.  For
example, the open source software developed by the Kuali Foundation
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kuali.org/">kuali.org</a>), used by educational
institutions to manage their finances, research grants, HR systems,
student information, etc, can hardly be said to scratch any individual
programmer's personal itch.  It
scratches an institutional itch.  But that itch arises directly from
the experiences of the institutions concerned, and therefore if
the project fails to satisfy them, they will know.  This arrangement
produces good software because the feedback loop flows in the right
direction.  The program isn't being written to be sold to someone else
so they can solve <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> problem.  It's being
written to solve one's <span class="emphasis"><em>own</em></span> problem, and then
shared with everyone, much as though the problem were a disease and
the software were medicine whose distribution is meant to completely
eradicate the epidemic.</p><p>This chapter is about how to introduce a new free software
project to the world, but many of its recommendations would sound
familiar to a health organization distributing medicine.  The goals
are very similar: you want to make it clear what the medicine does,
get it into the hands of the right people, and make sure that those
who receive it know how to use it.  But with software, you also want
to entice some of the recipients into joining the ongoing research
effort to improve the medicine.</p><p>Free software distribution is a twofold task.  The software
needs to acquire users, and to acquire developers.  These two needs
are not necessarily in conflict, but they do add some complexity to a
project's initial presentation.  Some information is useful for both
audiences, some is useful only for one or the other.  Both kinds of
information should subscribe to the principle of scaled presentation;
that is, the degree of detail presented at each stage should
correspond to the amount of time and effort put in by the
reader at that stage.  More effort should always result in more
reward.  When the two do 
not correlate tightly, people may quickly lose faith and stop
investing effort.</p><p>The corollary to this is that <span class="emphasis"><em>appearances
matter</em></span>.  Programmers, in particular, often don't like to
believe this.  Their love of substance over form is almost a point of
professional pride.  It's no accident that so many programmers exhibit
an antipathy for marketing and public relations work, nor that
professional graphic designers are often horrified at the designs
programmers come up with on their own.</p><p>This is a pity, because there are situations where form
<span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> substance, and project presentation is one of
them.  For example, the very first thing a visitor learns about a
project is what its web site looks like.  This information is absorbed
before any of the actual content on the site is
comprehended—before any of the text has been read or links
clicked on.  However unjust it may be, people cannot stop themselves
from forming an immediate first impression.  The site's appearance
signals whether care was taken in organizing the project's
presentation.  Humans have extremely sensitive antennae for detecting
the investment of care.  Most of us can tell in one glance whether a
web site was thrown together quickly or was given serious thought.
This is the first piece of information your project puts out, and the
impression it creates will carry over to the rest of the project by
association.</p><p>Thus, while much of this chapter talks about the content your
project should start out with, remember that its look and feel matter
too.  Because the project web site has to work for two different types
of visitors—users and developers—special attention
must be paid to clarity and directedness.  Although this is not the
place for a general treatise on web design, one principle is important
enough to deserve mention, particularly when the site serves multiple
(if overlapping) audiences: people should have a rough idea where a
link goes before clicking on it.  For example, it should be obvious
<span class="emphasis"><em>from looking at the links</em></span> to user documentation
that they lead to user documentation, and not to, say, developer
documentation.  Running a project is partly about supplying
information, but it's also about supplying comfort.  The mere presence
of certain standard offerings, in expected places, reassures users and
developers who are deciding whether they want to get involved.  It
says that this project has its act together, has anticipated the
questions people will ask, and has made an effort to answer them in a
way that requires minimal exertion on the part of the asker.  By
giving off this aura of preparedness, the project sends out a message:
"Your time will not be wasted if you get involved," which is exactly
what people need to hear.</p><p>If you use a "canned hosting" site (see <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#starting-with-canned-hosting">“Hosting”</a>), one advantage of that
choice is that those sites have a default layout that is similar from
project to project, and is pretty well-suited to presenting a project
to the world.  That layout can be customized, within certain
boundaries, but the default design prompts you to include the
information visitors are most likely to be looking for.</p><div class="sect2" title="But First, Look Around"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="look-around"/>But First, Look Around</h2></div></div></div><p>Before starting an open source project, there is one important
caveat:</p><p>Always look around to see if there's an existing project that
does what you want.  The chances are pretty good that whatever problem
you want solved now, someone else wanted solved before you.  If they
did solve it, and released their code under a free license, then
there's no reason for you to reinvent the wheel today.  There are
exceptions, of course: if you want to start a project as an
educational experience, pre-existing code won't help; or maybe the
project you have in mind is so specialized that you know there is zero
chance anyone else has done it.  But generally, there's no point not
looking, and the payoff can be huge.  If the usual Internet search
engines don't turn up anything, try searching directly on <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/">github.com</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://ohloh.net/">ohloh.net</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://freecode.com/">freecode.com</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/">code.google.com</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">sourceforge.net</a>, and in the
Free Software Foundation's directory of free software at <a class="ulink" href="http://directory.fsf.org/">directory.fsf.org</a>.</p><p>Even if you don't find exactly what you were looking for, you
might find something so close that it makes more sense to join that
project and add functionality than to start from scratch
yourself.</p></div></div><div class="sect1" title="Starting From What You Have"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="starting-from-what-you-have"/>Starting From What You Have</h1></div></div></div><p>You've looked around, found that nothing out there really fits
your needs, and decided to start a new project.</p><p>What now?</p><p>The hardest part about launching a free software project is
transforming a private vision into a public one.  You or your
organization may know perfectly well what you want, but expressing
that goal comprehensibly to the world is a fair amount of work.  It is
essential, however, that you take the time to do it.  You and the
other founders must decide what the project is really about—that
is, decide its limitations, what it <span class="emphasis"><em>won't</em></span> do as
well as what it will—and write up a mission statement.  This
part is usually not too hard, though it can sometimes reveal unspoken
assumptions and even disagreements about the nature of the project,
which is fine: better to resolve those now than later.  The next step
is to package up the project for public consumption, and this is,
basically, pure drudgery.</p><p>What makes it so laborious is that it consists mainly of
organizing and documenting things everyone already
knows—"everyone", that is, who's been involved in the project so
far.  Thus, for the people doing the work, there is no immediate
benefit.  They do not need a <code class="filename">README</code> file giving
an overview of the project, nor a design document.
They do not need a carefully arranged code tree conforming to the
informal but widespread standards of software source distributions.
Whatever way the source code is arranged is fine for them, because
they're already accustomed to it anyway, and if the code runs at all,
they know how to use it.  It doesn't even matter, for them, if the
fundamental architectural assumptions of the project remain
undocumented; they're already familiar with that too.</p><p>Newcomers, on the other hand, need all these things.  Fortunately,
they don't need them all at once.  It's not necessary for you to
provide every possible resource before taking a project public.  In a
perfect world, perhaps, every new open source project would start out
life with a thorough design document, a complete user manual (with
special markings for features planned but not yet implemented),
beautifully and portably packaged code, capable of running on any
computing platform, and so on.  In reality, taking care of all these
loose ends would be prohibitively time-consuming, and anyway, it's
work that one can reasonably hope others will help with once the
project is under way.</p><p>What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> necessary, however, is that enough
investment be put into presentation that newcomers can get past the
initial obstacle of unfamiliarity.  Think of it as the first step in a
bootstrapping process, to bring the project to a kind of minimum
activation energy.  I've heard this threshold called the
<em class="firstterm">hacktivation energy</em>: the amount of energy a
newcomer must put in before she starts getting something back.  The
lower a project's hacktivation energy, the better.  Your first task is
bring the hacktivation energy down to a level that encourages people
to get involved.</p><p>Each of the following subsections describes one important aspect
of starting a new project.  They are presented roughly in the order
that a new visitor would encounter them, though of course the order in
which you actually implement them might be different.  You can treat
them as a checklist.  When starting a project, just go down the list
and make sure you've got each item covered, or at least that you're
comfortable with the potential consequences if you've left one
out.</p><div class="sect2" title="Choose a Good Name"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="choosing-a-name"/>Choose a Good Name</h2></div></div></div><p>Put yourself in the shoes of someone who's just heard about your
project, perhaps by having stumbled across it while searching for
software to solve some problem.  The first thing they'll encounter is
the project's name.</p><p>A good name will not automatically make your project successful,
and a bad name will not doom it—well, a
<span class="emphasis"><em>really</em></span> bad name probably could do that, but we
start from the assumption that no one here is actively trying to make
their project fail.  However, a bad name can slow down adoption of the
project, either because people don't take it seriously, or because
they simply have trouble remembering it.</p><p>A good name:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Gives some idea what the project does, or at least
            is related in an obvious way, such that if one knows the
            name and knows what the project does, the name will come
            quickly to mind thereafter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is easy to remember.  Here, there is no getting
            around the fact that English has become the default
            language of the Internet: "easy to remember" usually means
            "easy for someone who can read English to remember."  Names that
            are puns dependent on native-speaker pronounciation, for
            example, will be opaque to the many non-native English
            readers out there.  If the pun is particularly compelling
            and memorable, it may still be worth it; just keep in mind
            that many people seeing the name will not hear it in their
            head the way a native speaker would.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Is not the same as some other project's name, and
            does not infringe on any trademarks.  This is just good
            manners, as well as good legal sense.  You don't want to
            create identity confusion.  It's hard enough to keep track
            of everything that's available on the Net already, without
            different things having the same name.</p><p>The resources mentioned earlier in
            <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#look-around" title="But First, Look Around">“But First, Look Around”</a> are useful in
            discovering whether another project already has the name
            you're thinking of.  For the U.S., trademark searches are
            available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.uspto.gov/">uspto.gov</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If possible, is available as a domain name in the
            <code class="systemitem">.com</code>,
            <code class="systemitem">.net</code>, and
            <code class="systemitem">.org</code> top-level domains.  You
            should pick one, probably <code class="systemitem">.org</code>,
            to advertise as the official home site for the project;
            the other two should forward there and are simply to
            prevent third parties from creating identity confusion
            around the project's name.  Even if you intend to host the
            project at some other site (see
            <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#starting-with-canned-hosting">“Hosting”</a>), you
            can still register project-specific domains and forward
            them to the hosting site.  It helps users a lot to have a
            simple URL to remember.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>If possible, is available as a username on <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and other
            microblog sites.  See <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#own-the-name" title="Own the name in the important namespaces">“Own the name in the important namespaces”</a> for
            more on this and its relationship to the domain name.</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><div class="sect3" title="Own the name in the important namespaces"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="own-the-name"/>Own the name in the important namespaces</h3></div></div></div><p>For large projects, it is a good idea to own the project's name
as many of the relevant namespaces on the Internet as you can.  By
namespaces, I mean not just the domain name system, but also online
services in which account names (usernames) are the publicly visible
handle by which people refer to the project.  If you have the same
name in all the places where people would look for you, you make it
easier for people to sustain a mild interest in the project until
they're ready to become more involved.</p><p>For example, the Gnome free desktop project has the <a class="ulink" href="http://gnome.org/">gnome.org</a> domain
name<sup>[<a id="idp5123392" href="#ftn.idp5123392" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup>, the <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/gnome">@gnome</a> Twitter handle, the <a class="ulink" href="https://identi.ca/gnome">gnome</a> username at
Identi.ca<sup>[<a id="idp5125616" href="#ftn.idp5125616" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup>, the <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/gnome">gnome</a> username at
GitHub.com<sup>[<a id="idp5128672" href="#ftn.idp5128672" class="footnote">14</a>]</sup>, and on the freenode IRC
network (see <a class="xref" href="ch03s06.html" title="IRC / Real-Time Chat Systems">“IRC / Real-Time Chat Systems”</a>) they have the channel
<code class="code">#gnome</code>, although they also maintain their own IRC servers
(where they control the channel namespace anyway, of course).</p><p>All this makes the Gnome project splendidly easy to find: it's
usually right where a potential contributor would expect it to be.  Of
course, Gnome is a large and complex project with thousands of
contributors and many subdivisions; the advantage to Gnome of being
easy to find is greater than it would be for a newer project, since by
now there are so many ways to get involved in Gnome.  But it will
certainly never <span class="emphasis"><em>harm</em></span> your project to own its name
in as many of the relevant namespaces as it can, and it can sometimes
help.  So when you start a project, think about what its online handle
should be and register that handle with the online services you think
you're likely to care about.  The ones mentioned above are probably a
good initial list, but you may know others that are relevant for the
particular subject area of your project.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Have a Clear Mission Statement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="mission-statement"/>Have a Clear Mission Statement</h2></div></div></div><p>Once they've found the project's home site, the next thing people
will look for is a quick description or mission statement, so they can
decide (within 30 seconds) whether or not they're interested in
learning more.  This should be prominently placed on the front page,
preferably right under the project's name.</p><p>The description should be concrete, limiting, and above all,
short.  Here's an example of a good one, from <a class="ulink" href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">hadoop.apache.org</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Apache™ Hadoop® project develops open-source
  software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework
  that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across
  clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is
  designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines,
  each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on
  hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is
  designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so
  delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of
  computers, each of which may be prone to failures.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>In just four sentences, they've hit all the high points, largely
by drawing on the reader's prior knowledge.  That's an important
point: it's okay to assume a minimally informed reader with a baseline
level of preparedness.  A reader who doesn't know what "clusters" and
"high-availability" mean in this context probably can't make much use
of Hadoop anyway, so there's no point writing for a reader who knows
any less than that.  The phrase "designed to detect and handle
failures at the application layer" will stand out to engineers who
have experience with large-scale computing clusters—when they
see those words, they'll know that the people behind Hadoop understand
that world, and will thus be more willing to give Hadoop
consideration.</p><p>Those who remain interested after reading the mission statement
will next want to see more details, perhaps some user or developer
documentation, and eventually will want to download something.  But
before any of that, they'll need to be sure it's open source.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="State That the Project is Free"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="state-freedom"/>State That the Project is Free</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>The front page must make it unambiguously clear that
the project is open source.</em></span> This may seem obvious, but you
would be surprised how many projects forget to do it.  I have seen
free software project web sites where the front page not only did not
say which particular free license the software was distributed under,
but did not even state outright that the software was free at all.
Sometimes the crucial bit of information was relegated to the
Downloads page, or the Developers page, or some other place that
required one more mouse click to get to.  In extreme cases, the
license was not given anywhere on the web site at all—the only
way to find it was to download the software and look at a license file
inside.</p><p>Please don't make this mistake.  Such an omission can lose many
potential developers and users.  State up front, right below the
mission statement, that the project is "free software" or "open source
software", and give the exact license.  A quick guide to choosing a
license is given in
<a class="xref" href="ch02s02.html" title="Choosing a License and Applying It">“Choosing a License and Applying It”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>, and
licensing issues are discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="ch10.html" title="10장. Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">10장. <em>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</em></a>.</p><p>By this point, our hypothetical visitor has
determined—probably in a minute or less—that she's
interested in spending, say, at least five more minutes investigating
this project.  The next sections describe what she should encounter in
that five minutes.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Features and Requirements List"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="features-and-requirements"/>Features and Requirements List</h2></div></div></div><p>There should be a brief list of the features the software
supports (if something isn't completed yet, you can still list it, but
put "<span class="emphasis"><em>planned</em></span>" or
"<span class="emphasis"><em>in progress</em></span>" next to it), and the kind of
computing environment required to run the software.  Think of the
features/requirements list as what you would give to someone asking
for a quick summary of the software.  It is often just a logical
expansion of the mission statement.  For example, the mission
statement might say:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>To create a full-text indexer and search engine
  with a rich API, for use by programmers in providing search
  services for large collections of text files.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The features and requirements list would give the details,
clarifying the mission statement's scope:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Features:</em></span></p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Searches plain text, HTML, and

whether this software has any hope of working for them, and they can
consider getting involved as developers too.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Development Status"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="development-status"/>Development Status</h2></div></div></div><p>Visitors usually want to know how a project is doing.  For new
projects, they want to know the gap between the project's promise and
current reality.  For mature projects, they want to know how actively
it is maintained, how often it puts out new releases, how responsive
it is likely to be to bug reports, etc.</p><p>There are a couple of different avenues for providing answers to
these questions.  One is to have a development status page, listing
the project's near-term goals and needs (for example, it might be
looking for developers with a particular kind of expertise).  The page
can also give a history of past releases, with feature lists, so
visitors can get an idea of how the project defines "progress", and
how quickly it makes progress according to that definition.  Some
projects structure their development status page as a roadmap that
includes the future: past events are shown on the dates they actually
happened, future ones on the approximate dates the project hopes they
will happen.</p><p>The other way — not mutually exclusive with the
first, and in fact probably best done in combination with
it — is to have various automatically-maintained
counters and indicators embedded in the projects's front page and/or
its developer landing page, showing various pieces of information
that, in the aggregate, give a sense of the project's development
status and progress.  For example, an Announcements or News panel
showing recent news items, a Twitter or other microblog stream showing
notices that match the project's designated hashtags, a timeline of
recent releases, a panel showing recent activity in the bug tracker
(bugs filed, bugs responded to), another showing mailing list or
discussion forum activity, etc.  Each such indicator should be a
gateway to further information of its type: for example, clicking on
the "recent bugs" panel should take one to the full bug tracker, or at
least to an expanded view into bug tracker activity.</p><p>Really, there are two slightly different meanings of
"development status" being conflated here.  One is the formal sense:
where does the project stand in relation to its stated goals, and how
fast is it making progress.  The other is less formal but just as
useful: how active is this project?  Is stuff going on?  Are there
people here, getting things done?  Often that latter notion is what a
visitor is most interested in.  Whether or not a project met its most
recent milestone is sometimes not as interesting as the more
fundamental question of whether it has an active community of
developers around it.</p><p>The two notions of development status are, of course, related,
and a well-presented project shows both kinds.  The information can be
divided between the project's front page (show enough there to give an
overview of both types of development status) and a more
developer-oriented page.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Example: Launchpad Status Indicators"><a id="launchpad-status-indicators"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Example: Launchpad Status Indicators</strong></p></div></div></div><p>One site that does a pretty good job of showing
developer-oriented status indicators is Launchpad.net.  Launchpad.net
is a bit unusual in that it is both a primary hosting platform for
some projects, and a secondary, packaging-oriented site for others (or
rather, for those others it is the primary site for the "project" of
getting that particular program packaged for the Ubuntu GNU/Linux
operating system, which Launchpad was specifically designed to
support).  In either case, a project's landing page on Launchpad shows
a variety of automatically-maintained status indicators that quickly
give an idea of where the project stands.  While simply imitating a
Launchpad page is probably not a good idea — your own
project should think carefully about what its best development status
indicators are — Launchpad project pages do provide
some good examples of the possibilities.  Start from the top of a
project page there and scroll down: <a class="ulink" href="https://launchpad.net/drizzle">launchpad.net/drizzle</a>.

temptation to inflate or hype the development status.  Everyone knows that
software evolves by stages; there's no shame in saying "This is alpha
software with known bugs.  It runs, and works at least some of the
time, but use at your own risk."  Such language won't scare away the
kinds of developers you need at that stage.  As for users, one of the
worst things a project can do is attract users before the software is
ready for them.  A reputation for instability or bugginess is very
hard to shake, once acquired.  Conservativism pays off in the long
run; it's always better for the software to be
<span class="emphasis"><em>more</em></span> stable than the user expected than less, and
pleasant surprises produce the best kind of word-of-mouth.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Alpha and Beta"><a id="alpha-and-beta"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Alpha and Beta</strong></p></div></div></div><p>The term <em class="firstterm">alpha</em> usually means a first
  release, with which users can get real work done and which has all
  the intended functionality, but which also has known bugs.  The main
  purpose of alpha software is to generate feedback, so the developers
  know what to work on.  The next stage, <em class="firstterm">beta</em>,
  means the software has had all the serious bugs fixed, but has not
  yet been tested enough to certify for production release.  The purpose of beta
  software is to either become the official release, assuming no bugs
  are found, or provide detailed feedback to the developers so they
  can reach the official release quickly.  The difference between
  alpha and beta is very much a matter of judgement.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Downloads"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="downloads"/>Downloads</h2></div></div></div><p>The software should be downloadable as source code in standard
formats.  When a project is first getting started, binary (executable)
packages are not necessary, unless the software has such complicated
build requirements or dependencies that merely getting it to run would
be a lot of work for most people.  (But if this is the case, the
project is going to have a hard time attracting developers
anyway!)</p><p>The distribution mechanism should be as convenient, standard,
and low-overhead as possible.  If you were trying to eradicate a
disease, you wouldn't distribute the medicine in such a way that it
requires a non-standard syringe size to administer.  Likewise,
software should conform to standard build and installation methods;
the more it deviates from the standards, the more potential users and
developers will give up and go away confused.</p><p>That sounds obvious, but many projects don't bother to
standardize their installation procedures until very late in the game,
telling themselves they can do it any time: <span class="emphasis"><em>"We'll sort all
that stuff out when the code is closer to being ready."</em></span>
What they don't realize is that by putting off the boring work of
finishing the build and installation procedures, they are actually
making the code take longer to get ready—because they
discourage developers who might otherwise have contributed to the
code, if only they could build and test it.  Most insidiously, the
project won't even <span class="emphasis"><em>know</em></span> it's
losing all those developers, because the process is an accumulation of
non-events: someone visits a web site, downloads the software, tries
to build it, fails, gives up and goes away.  Who will ever know it
happened, except the person themselves?  No one working on the project
will realize that someone's interest and good will have been silently
squandered.</p><p>Boring work with a high payoff should always be done early, and
significantly lowering the project's barrier to entry through good
packaging brings a very high payoff.</p><p>When you release a downloadable package, give it a unique
version number, so that people can compare any two releases and know
which supersedes the other.  That way they can report bugs against a
particular release (which helps respondents to figure out if the bug
is already fixed or not).  A detailed discussion of version
numbering can be found in <a class="xref" href="ch07.html#release-numbering" title="Release Numbering">“Release Numbering”</a>, and the
details of standardizing build and installation procedures are covered

install and use the software, but it's not enough for those who want
to debug or add new features.  Nightly source snapshots can help, but
they're still not fine-grained enough for a thriving development
community.  People need real-time access to the latest sources, and a
way to submit changes based on those sources.</p><p>The solution is to use a version control
system — specifically, an online, publicly-accessible
version controlled repository, from which anyone can check out the
project's materials and subsequently get updates.  A version control
repository is a sign—to both users and developers—that
this project is making an effort to give people what they need to
participate.  As of this writing, many open source projects use <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>, which offers unlimited
free public version control hosting for open source projects.  While
GitHub is not the only choice, nor even the only good choice, it's a
reasonable one for most projects<sup>[<a id="idp5186832" href="#ftn.idp5186832" class="footnote">15</a>]</sup>.
Version control infrastructure is discussed in detail in <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html" title="Version Control">“Version Control”</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="3장. Technical Infrastructure">3장. <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a></span>.</p><p>The same goes for the project's bug tracker.  The importance of
a bug tracking system lies not only in its day-to-day usefulness to
developers, but in what it signifies for project observers.  For many
people, an accessible bug database is one of the strongest signs that
a project should be taken seriously: the higher the number of bugs in
the database, the <span class="emphasis"><em>better</em></span> the project looks.  This
might seem counterintuitive, but remember that the number of bug
reports filed really depends on three things: the absolute number of
actual software defects present in the code, the number of people
using the software,
and the convenience with which those people can report new bugs.  Of
these three factors, the latter two are much more significant than the
first.  Any software of sufficient size and complexity has an
essentially arbitrary number of bugs waiting to be discovered.  The
real question is, how well will the project do at recording and
prioritizing those bugs?  A project with a large and well-maintained
bug database (meaning bugs are responded to promptly, duplicate bugs
are unified, etc.) therefore makes a better impression than a project
with no bug database, or a nearly empty database.</p><p>Of course, if your project is just getting started, then the bug
database will contain very few bugs, and there's not much you can do
about that.  But if the status page emphasizes the project's youth,
and if people looking at the bug database can see that most filings
have taken place recently, they can extrapolate from that the project
still has a healthy <span class="emphasis"><em>rate</em></span> of filings, and they
will not be unduly alarmed by the low absolute number of bugs
recorded.<sup>[<a id="idp5193456" href="#ftn.idp5193456" class="footnote">16</a>]</sup></p><p>Note that bug trackers are often used to track not only software
bugs, but enhancement requests, documentation changes, pending tasks,
and more.  The details of running a bug tracker are covered in
<a class="xref" href="ch03s05.html" title="Bug Tracker">“Bug Tracker”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="3장. Technical Infrastructure">3장. <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a></span>, so I won't
go into them here.  The important thing from a presentation point of
view is just to <span class="emphasis"><em>have</em></span> a bug tracker, and to make
sure that fact is visible from the front page of the project.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Communications Channels"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="communications-channels"/>Communications Channels</h2></div></div></div><p>Visitors usually want to know how to reach the human beings
involved with the project.  Provide the addresses of mailing lists,
chat rooms, IRC channels (<a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="3장. Technical Infrastructure">3장. <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a>),
and any other forums where others
involved with the software can be reached.  Make it clear that you and
the other authors of the project are subscribed to these mailing
lists, so people see there's a way to give feedback that will reach
the developers.  Your presence on the lists does not imply a
committment to answer all questions or implement all feature requests.
In the long run, probably only a fraction users will use the forums
anyway, but the others will be comforted to know that they
<span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> if they ever needed to.</p><p>In the early stages of a project, there's no need to have
separate user and developer forums.  It's much better to have everyone
involved with the software talking together, in one "room."  Among
early adopters, the distinction between developer and user is often
fuzzy; to the extent that the distinction can be made, the ratio of
developers to users is usually much higher in the early days of the
project than later on.  While you can't assume that every early
adopter is a programmer who wants to hack on the software, you can
assume that they are at least interested in following development
discussions and in getting a sense of the project's direction.</p><p>As this chapter is only about getting a project started, it's
enough merely to say that these communications forums need to exist.
Later, in <a class="xref" href="ch06s04.html" title="Handling Growth">“Handling Growth”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="6장. Communications">6장. <em>Communications</em></a></span>, we'll examine where
and how to set up such forums, the ways in which they might need
moderation or other management, and how to separate user forums from
developer forums, when the time comes, without creating an
unbridgeable gulf.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Developer Guidelines"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="developer-guidelines"/>Developer Guidelines</h2></div></div></div><p>If someone is considering contributing to the project, she'll
look for developer guidelines.  Developer guidelines are not so much
technical as social: they explain how the developers interact with
each other and with the users, and ultimately how things get
done.</p><p>This topic is covered in detail in
<a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html" title="Writing It All Down">“Writing It All Down”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="4장. Social and Political Infrastructure">4장. <em>Social and Political Infrastructure</em></a></span>, but the basic
elements of developer guidelines are:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>pointers to forums for interaction with other
            developers</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>instructions on how to report bugs and submit
            patches</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>some indication of <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span>
            development is usually done and how decisions are
            made—is the project a benevolent dictatorship, a
            democracy, or something else</p></li></ul></div><p>

No pejorative sense is intended by "dictatorship", by the way.  It's
perfectly okay to run a tyranny where one particular developer has
veto power over all changes.  Many successful projects work this way.
The important thing is that the project come right out and say so.  A
tyranny pretending to be a democracy will turn people off; a tyranny
that says it's a tyranny will do fine as long as the tyrant is
competent and trusted.  (See <a class="xref" href="ch04.html#forkability" title="Forkability">“Forkability”</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="4장. Social and Political Infrastructure">4장. <em>Social and Political Infrastructure</em></a></span>
for why dictatorship in open source projects doesn't have the same
implications as dictatorship in other areas of life.)</p><p><a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/">subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide</a>
is an example of particularly thorough developer guidelines; the
LibreOffice guidelines at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development">wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development</a> are also a good
example.</p><p>The separate issue of providing a programmer's introduction to
the software is discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#developer-documentation" title="Developer documentation">“Developer documentation”</a><span>
later in this chapter</span>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="documentation"/>Documentation</h2></div></div></div><p>Documentation is essential.  There needs to be
<span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> for people to read, even if it's
rudimentary and incomplete.  This falls squarely into the "drudgery"
category referred to earlier, and is often the first area where a new
open source project falls down.  Coming up with a mission statement
and feature list, choosing a license, summarizing development
status—these are all relatively small tasks, which can be
definitively completed and usually need not be revisited once done.
Documentation, on the other hand, is never really finished, which may
be one reason people sometimes delay starting it at all.</p><p>The most insidious thing is that documentation's utility to
those writing it is the reverse of its utility to those who will read
it.  The most important documentation for initial users is the basics:
how to quickly set up the software, an overview of how it works,
perhaps some guides to doing common tasks.  Yet these are exactly the
things the <span class="emphasis"><em>writers</em></span> of the documentation know all
too well—so well that it can be difficult for them to see
things from the reader's point of view, and to laboriously spell out
the steps that (to the writers) seem so obvious as to be unworthy of
mention.</p><p>There's no magic solution to this problem.  Someone just needs
to sit down and write the stuff, and then, most importantly,
incorporate feedback from readers.  Use a simple, easy-to-edit format
such as HTML, plain text, Markdown, ReStructuredText, or some
variant of XML—something that's convenient for lightweight,
quick improvements on the spur of the moment<sup>[<a id="idp5220624" href="#ftn.idp5220624" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup>.  This is not only to remove any
overhead that might impede the original writers from making
incremental improvements, but also for those who join the project
later and want to work on the documentation.</p><p>One way to ensure basic initial documentation gets done is to
limit its scope in advance.  That way, writing it at least won't feel
like an open-ended task.  A good rule of thumb is that it should meet
the following minimal criteria:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Tell the reader clearly how much technical
            expertise they're expected to have.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Describe clearly and thoroughly how to set up
            the software, and somewhere near the beginning of the
            documentation, tell the user how to run some sort of
            diagnostic test or simple command to confirm that
            they've set things up correctly.  Startup
            documentation is in some ways more important than
            actual usage documentation.  The more effort someone has
            invested in installing and getting started with the
            software, the more persistent she'll be in figuring out
            advanced functionality that's not well-documented.
            When people abandon, they abandon early; therefore,
            it's the earliest stages, like installation, that need
            the most support.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Give one tutorial-style example of how to do a
            common task.  Obviously, many examples for many tasks
            would be even better, but if time is limited, pick one
            task and walk through it thoroughly.  Once someone
            sees that the software <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> be
            used for one thing, they'll start to explore what else
            it can do on their own—and, if you're lucky,
            start filling in the documentation themselves.  Which
            brings us to the next point...</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Label the areas where the documentation is known
            to be incomplete.  By showing the readers that you are
            aware of its deficiencies, you align yourself with
            their point of view.  Your empathy reassures them that
            they don't face a struggle to convince the project of
            what's important.  These labels needn't represent
            promises to fill in the gaps by any particular date
           —it's equally legitimate to treat them as open
            requests for volunteer help.</p></li></ul></div><p>The last point is of wider importance, actually, and can be
applied to the entire project, not just the documentation.  An
accurate accounting of known deficiencies is the norm in the open
source world.  You don't have to exaggerate the project's
shortcomings, just identify them scrupulously and dispassionately when
the context calls for it (whether in the documentation, in the bug
tracking database, or on a mailing list discussion).  No one will
treat this as defeatism on the part of the project, nor as a
commitment to solve the problems by a certain date, unless the project
makes such a commitment explicitly.  Since anyone who uses the
software will discover the deficiencies for themselves, it's much
better for them to be psychologically prepared—then the
project will look like it has a solid knowledge of how it's
doing.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Maintaining a FAQ"><a id="starting-a-faq"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>Maintaining a FAQ</strong></p></div></div></div><p>A <em class="firstterm">FAQ</em> ("Frequently Asked Questions"
  document) can be one of the best investments a project makes in
  terms of educational payoff.  FAQs are highly tuned to the questions
  users and developers actually ask—as opposed to the questions
  you might have <span class="emphasis"><em>expected</em></span> them to ask—and
  therefore, a well-maintained FAQ tends to give those who consult it
  exactly what they're looking for.  The FAQ is often the first place
  users look when they encounter a problem, often even in preference
  to the official manual, and it's probably the document in your
  project most likely to be linked to from other sites.</p><p>Unfortunately, you cannot make the FAQ at the start of the
  project.  Good FAQs are not written, they are grown.  They are by
  definition reactive documents, evolving over time in response to
  the questions people ask about the software.  Since it's impossible
  to correctly anticipate those questions, it is impossible to sit
  down and write a useful FAQ from scratch.</p><p>Therefore, don't waste your time trying to.  You may, however,
  find it useful to set up a mostly blank FAQ template with just a few
  questions and answers, so there will
  be an obvious place for people to contribute questions and answers
  after the project is under way.  At this stage, the most important
  property is not completeness, but <span class="emphasis"><em>convenience</em></span>:
  if the FAQ is easy to
  add to, people will add to it.  (Proper FAQ maintenance is a
  non-trivial and intriguing problem: see <a class="xref" href="ch08s02.html#faq-manager">“"Manager" Does Not Mean "Owner"”</a><span>in

(directly from the web site), <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> in the
downloadable distribution of the software (see
<a class="xref" href="ch07s04.html" title="Packaging">“Packaging”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="7장. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">7장. <em>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</em></a></span>).  It needs to be
online, in browsable form, because people often read documentation
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> downloading software for the first time,
as a way of helping them decide whether to download at all.  But it
should also accompany the software, on the principle that downloading
should supply (i.e., make locally accessible) everything one needs to
use the package.</p><p>For online documentation, make sure that there is a link that
brings up the <span class="emphasis"><em>entire</em></span> documentation in one HTML
page (put a note like "monolithic" or "all-in-one" or "single large
page" next to the link, so people know that it might take a while to
load).  This is useful because people often want to search for a
specific word or phrase across the entire documentation.  Generally,
they already know what they're looking for; they just can't remember
what section it's in.  For such people, nothing is more frustrating
than encountering one HTML page for the table of contents, then a
different page for the introduction, then a different page for
installation instructions, etc.  When the pages are broken up like
that, their browser's search function is useless.  The separate-page
style is useful for those who already know what section they need, or
who want to read the entire documentation from front to back in
sequence.  But this is not necessarily the most common way
documentation is accessed.  Often, someone who is basically
familiar with the software is coming back to search for a specific
word or phrase, and to fail to provide them with a single, searchable
document would only make their lives harder.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Developer documentation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="developer-documentation"/>Developer documentation</h3></div></div></div><p>Developer documentation is written by programmers to help other
programmers
understand the code, so they can repair and extend it.  This is
somewhat different from the <span class="emphasis"><em>developer guidelines</em></span>
discussed earlier, which are more social than technical.  Developer
guidelines tell programmers how to get along with each other;
developer documentation tells them how to get along with the code
itself.  The two are often packaged together in one document for
convenience (as with the <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/">subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide</a> example given
earlier), but they don't have to be.</p><p>Although developer documentation can be very helpful, there's no
reason to delay a release to do it.  As long as the original authors
are available (and willing) to answer questions about the code, that's
enough to start with.  In fact, having to answer the same questions
over and over is a common motivation for writing documentation.  But
even before it's written, determined contributors will still manage to
find their way around the code.  The force that drives people to spend
time learning a code base is that the code does something useful for
them.  If people have faith in that, they will take the time to figure
things out; if they don't have that faith, no amount of developer
documentation will get or keep them.</p><p>So if you have time to write documentation for only one
audience, write it for users.  All user documentation is, in effect,
developer documentation as well; any programmer who's going to work on
a piece of software will need to be familiar with how to use it too.
Later, when you see programmers asking the same questions over and
over, take the time to write up some separate documents just for
them.</p><p>Some projects use wikis for their initial documentation, or even
as their primary documentation.  In my experience, this works best
if the wiki is actively maintained by a few people who agree on how
the documentation is to be organized and what sort of "voice" it
should have.  See

sample files to download.  For web-based software, the gold standard
is a demo site, of course, assuming the software is amenable to
that.</p><p>The main thing is to cater to people's desire for instant
gratification in the way they are most likely to expect.  A single
screenshot or video can be more convincing than paragraphs of
descriptive text and mailing list chatter, because it is proof

  says "Watch our video", because in the former case they know what
  they're getting into before they click — and they'll
  watch it better, because they've mentally prepared the necessary

web site — the one with the pretty pictures and the
"About" page and the gentle introductions and videos and guided tours
and all that stuff — and their developers' site, where
everything's grungy and full of closely-spaced text in monospace fonts
and impenetrable abbreviations.</p><p>Well, I exaggerate.  A bit.  In any case, in the early stages of
your project it is not so important to distinguish between these two
audiences.  Most of the interested visitors you get will be
developers, or at least people who are comfortable trying out new
code.  Over time, you may find it makes sense to have a user-facing
site (of course, if your project is a code library, those "users"
might be other programmers) and a somewhat separate collaboration area
for those interested in participating in development.  The
collaboration site would have the code repository, bug tracker,
development wiki, links to development mailing lists, etc.  The two
sites should link to each other, and in particular it's important that
the user-facing site make it clear that the project is open source and
where the open source development activity can be
found.<sup>[<a id="idp5278944" href="#ftn.idp5278944" class="footnote">18</a>]</sup></p><p>In the past, many projects set up the developer site and
infrastructure themselves.  Over the last decade or so, however, most
open source projects — and almost all the new
ones — just use one of the "canned hosting" sites that
have sprung up to offer these services for free to open source
projects.  By far the most popular such site, as of this writing in
mid-2013, is <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>, and
if you don't have a strong preference about where to host, you should
probably just choose GitHub; many developers are already familiar with
it and have personal accounts there.  <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">“Canned Hosting”</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="3장. Technical Infrastructure">3장. <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a></span> has a more detailed
discussion of the questions to consider when choosing a canned hosting
site, and an overview of the most popular ones.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp5123392" href="#idp5123392" class="para">12</a>] </sup>They didn't manage to get gnome.com or gnome.net,
but that's okay — if you only have one, and it's .org,
it's fine.  That's usually the first one people look for when they're
seeking the open source project of that name.  If they couldn't get
"gnome.org" itself, a typical solution would be to get
"gnomeproject.org" instead, and many projects solve the problem that
way.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp5125616" href="#idp5125616" class="para">13</a>] </sup> <a class="ulink" href="https://identi.ca/">Identi.ca</a> is a microblog / social networking that a number of
free software developers use; its code is open source and made

developer-oriented projects, I recommend at least doing all status
microposts — colloquially referred to as
"tweets" — on both Identi.ca and Twitter.  While the
total number of people on Identi.ca is far smaller than on Twitter,
the percentage of them that are likely to be interested in news about
an open source project is far higher, at least as of this writing in
2013 and for some years preceding that.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp5128672" href="#idp5128672" class="para">14</a>] </sup>While the master copy of Gnome's source code

this matters for your project is a complex question, and is addressed
