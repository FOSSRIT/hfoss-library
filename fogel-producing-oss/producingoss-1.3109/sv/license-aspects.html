available, in the important respects they all say the same things:
that anyone can modify the code, that anyone can redistribute it both
in original and modified form, and that the copyright holders and
authors provide no warranties whatsoever (avoiding liability is
especially important given that people might run modified versions
without even knowing it).  The differences between licences boil down
to a few oft-recurring issues:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">compatibility with proprietary licenses</span></dt><dd><p>Some free licenses allow the covered code to be
              used in proprietary programs.  This does not affect the
              licensing terms of the proprietary program: it is still
              as proprietary as ever, it just happens to contain some
              code from a non-proprietary source.  The Apache License,
              X Consortium License, BSD-style license, and the
              MIT-style license are all examples of
              proprietary-compatible licenses.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">compatibility with other free licenses</span></dt><dd><p>Most free licenses are compatible with each other,
              meaning that code under one license can be combined with
              code under another, and the result distributed under
              either license without violating the terms of the
              other.  The major exception to this is the GNU General
              Public License, which requires that any work using GPLed
              code be itself distributed under the GPL, and without
              adding any further restrictions beyond what the GPL
              requires.  The GPL is compatible with some free
              licenses, but not with others.  This is discussed in more
              detail in
              <a class="xref" href="license-compatibility.html" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">&#8221;The GPL and License Compatibility&#8221;</a><span> later in this chapter</span>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">enforcement of crediting</span></dt><dd><p>Some free licenses stipulate that any use of the
              covered code be accompanied by a notice, whose placement
              and display is usually specified, giving credit to the
              authors or copyright holders of the code.  These
              licenses are often still proprietary-compatible: they do
              not necessarily demand that the derivative work be free,
              merely that credit be given to the free code.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">protection of trademark</span></dt><dd><p>A variant of credit enforcement.
              Trademark-protecting licenses specify that the name of
              the original software (or its copyright holders, or
              their institution, etc.) may <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
              used by derivative works without prior written
              permission.  Although credit enforcement insists that a
              certain name be used, and trademark protection insists
              that it not be used, they are both expressions of the
              same desire: that the original code's reputation be
              preserved and transmitted, but not tarnished by
              association.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">patent snapback</span></dt><dd><p>Both the GNU General Public License version 3 and
              the Apache License version 2 contain language designed
              to prevent people from using patent law to take away the
              rights granted (under copyright law) by the
              licenses.  They require contributors to grant patent
              licenses along with their contribution, covering any
              patents licenseable by the contributor that would be
              infringed by their contribution (or by the incorporation
              of their contribution into the work as a whole).  Then
              they go further: if someone using software under the
              license initiates patent litigation against another party,
              claiming that the covered work infringes, the initiator
              automatically <span class="emphasis"><em>loses</em></span> all the
              patent grants otherwise provided for that work by the
              license, and in the case of the GPLv3 loses their right
              to distribute under the license altogether.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">protection of "artistic integrity"</span></dt><dd><p>Some licenses (the Artistic License, used
              for the most popular implementation of the Perl
              programming language, and Donald Knuth's TeX license,
              for example) require that modification and
              redistribution be done in a manner that distinguishes
              clearly between the pristine original version of the
              code and any modifications.  They permit essentially the
              same freedoms as other free license, but impose certain
              requirements that make the integrity of the original
              code easy to verify.  These licenses have not caught on
              much beyond the specific programs they were made for,
              and will not be discussed in this chapter; they are
              mentioned here only for the sake of completeness.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Most of these stipulations are not mutually exclusive, and some
licenses include several.  The common thread among them is that they
place demands on the recipient in exchange for the recipient's right
to use and/or redistribute the code.  For example, some projects want
their name and reputation to be transmitted along with the code, and
this is worth imposing the extra burden of a credit or trademark
clause; depending on its onerousness, that burden may result in some
users choosing a package with a less demanding license.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="legal.html">Föregående</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="legal.html">Upp</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="license-compatibility.html">Nästa</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Kapitel 9.
