working with the Subversion project
(<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>).  Subversion is an open
source version control system, written from scratch, and intended to
replace CVS as the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span> version
control system of choice in the open source community.  The project
was started by my employer, CollabNet
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_top">http://www.collab.net/</a>), in early 2000, and thank
goodness CollabNet understood right from the start how to run it as a
truly collaborative, distributed effort.  We got a lot of volunteer
developer buy-in early on; today there are 50-some developers on
the project, of whom only a few are CollabNet employees.</p><p>Subversion is in many ways a classic example of an open source
project, and I ended up drawing on it more heavily than I originally
expected.  This was partly a matter of convenience: whenever I needed
an example of a particular phenomenon, I could usually call one up
from Subversion right off the top of my head.  But it was also a
matter of verification.  Although I am involved in other free software
projects to varying degrees, and talk to friends and acquaintances
involved in many more, one quickly realizes when writing for print
that all assertions need to be fact-checked.  I didn't want to make
statements about events in other projects based only on what I could
read in their public mailing list archives.  If someone were to try
that with Subversion, I knew, she'd be right about half the time and
wrong the other half.  So when drawing inspiration or examples from a
project with which I didn't have direct experience, I tried to first
talk to an informant there, someone I could trust to explain what was
really going on.</p><p>Subversion has been my job for the last 5 years, but I've been
involved in free software for 12.  Other projects that influenced this
book include:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The GNU Emacs text editor project at the Free
            Software Foundation, in which I maintain a few small
            packages.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Concurrent Versions System (CVS), which I worked on
            intensely in 1994&#8211;1995 with Jim Blandy, but have been
            involved with only intermittently since.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The collection of open source projects known as the
            Apache Software Foundation, especially the Apache Portable
            Runtime (APR) and Apache HTTP Server.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>OpenOffice.org, the Berkeley Database from
            Sleepycat, and MySQL Database; I have not been
            involved with these projects personally, but have observed
            them and, in some cases, talked to people there.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>GNU Debugger (GDB) (likewise).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The Debian Project (likewise).</p></li></ul></div><p>This is not a complete list, of course.  Like most open source
programmers, I keep loose tabs on many different projects, just to
have a sense of the general state of things.  I won't name all of them
here, but they are mentioned in the text where appropriate.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="audience.html">Föregående</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="preface.html">Upp</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="acknowledgments.html">Nästa</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Who Should Read This Book? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Hem</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Acknowledgments</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
