would, and for much of that time felt rather like a grand piano
suspended above my head wherever I went.  Without help from many
people, I would not have been able to complete it while staying
sane.</p><p>Andy Oram, my editor at O'Reilly, was a writer's dream.  Aside
from knowing the field intimately (he suggested many of the topics),
he has the rare gift of knowing what one meant to say and helping one
find the right way to say it.  It has been an honor to work with him.
Thanks also to Chuck Toporek for steering this proposal to Andy right
away.</p><p>Brian Fitzpatrick reviewed almost all of the material as I wrote
it, which not only made the book better, but kept me writing when I
wanted to be anywhere in the world but in front of the computer.  Ben
Collins-Sussman and Mike Pilato also checked up on progress, and were
always happy to discuss &#8212; sometimes at length &#8212; whatever topic
I was trying to cover that week.  They also noticed when I slowed
down, and gently nagged when necessary.  Thanks, guys.</p><p>Biella Coleman was writing her dissertation at the same time
I was writing this book.  She knows what it means to sit down and
write every day, and provided an inspiring example as well as a
sympathetic ear.  She also has a fascinating anthropologist's-eye view
of the free software movement, giving both ideas and references that I
was able use in the book.  Alex Golub &#8212; another anthropologist
with one foot in the free software world, and also finishing his
dissertation at the same time &#8212; was exceptionally supportive early
on, which helped a great deal.</p><p>Micah Anderson somehow never seemed too oppressed by his own
writing gig, which was inspiring in a sick, envy-generating sort of
way, but he was ever ready with friendship, conversation, and (on at
least one occasion) technical support.  Thanks, Micah!</p><p>Jon Trowbridge and Sander Striker gave both encouragement and
concrete help &#8212; their broad experience in free software provided
material I couldn't have gotten any other way.</p><p>Thanks to Greg Stein not only for friendship and well-timed
encouragement, but for showing the Subversion project how important
regular code review is in building a programming community.  Thanks
also to Brian Behlendorf, who tactfully drummed into our heads the
importance of having discussions publicly; I hope that principle is
reflected throughout this book.</p><p>Thanks to Benjamin "Mako" Hill and Seth Schoen, for various
conversations about free software and its politics; to Zack Urlocker
and Louis Suarez-Potts for taking time out of their busy schedules to
be interviewed; to Shane on the Slashcode list for allowing his post
to be quoted; and to Haggen So for his enormously helpful comparison
of canned hosting sites.</p><p>Thanks to Alla Dekhtyar, Polina, and Sonya for their unflagging
and patient encouragement.  I'm very glad that I will no longer have
to end (or rather, try unsuccessfully to end) our evenings early to go
home and work on "The Book."</p><p>Thanks to Jack Repenning for friendship, conversation, and a
stubborn refusal to ever accept an easy wrong analysis when a harder
right one is available.  I hope that some of his long experience with
both software development and the software industry rubbed off on this
book.</p><p>CollabNet was exceptionally generous in allowing me a flexible
schedule to write, and didn't complain when it went on far longer than
originally planned.  I don't know all the intricacies of how
management arrives at such decisions, but I suspect Sandhya Klute, and
later Mahesh Murthy, had something to do with it &#8212; my thanks to
them both.</p><p>The entire Subversion development team has been an inspiration
for the past five years, and much of what is in this book I learned
from working with them.  I won't thank them all by name here, because
there are too many, but I implore any reader who runs into a
Subversion committer to immediately buy that committer the drink of
his choice &#8212; I certainly plan to.</p><p>Many times I ranted to Rachel Scollon about the state of the
book; she was always willing to listen, and somehow managed to make
the problems seem smaller than before we talked.  That helped a
lot &#8212; thanks.</p><p>Thanks (again) to Noel Taylor, who must surely have wondered why
I wanted to write another book given how much I complained the last
time, but whose friendship and leadership of Golosá helped keep
music and good fellowship in my life even in the busiest times.
Thanks also to Matthew Dean and Dorothea Samtleben, friends and
long-suffering musical partners, who were very understanding as my
excuses for not practicing piled up.  Megan Jennings was constantly
supportive, and genuinely interested in the topic even though it was
unfamiliar to her &#8212; a great tonic for an insecure writer.  Thanks,
pal!</p><p>I had four knowledgeable and diligent reviewers for this book:
Yoav Shapira, Andrew Stellman, Davanum Srinivas, and Ben Hyde.  If I
had been able to incorporate all of their excellent suggestions, this
would be a better book.  As it was, time constraints forced me to pick
and choose, but the improvements were still significant.  Any errors
that remain are entirely my own.</p><p>My parents, Frances and Henry, were wonderfully supportive as
always, and as this book is less technical than the previous one, I
hope they'll find it somewhat more readable.</p><p>Finally, I would like to thank the dedicatees, Karen Underhill
and Jim Blandy.  Karen's friendship and understanding have meant
everything to me, not only during the writing of this book but for the
last seven years.  I simply would not have finished without her help.
Likewise for Jim, a true friend and a hacker's hacker, who first
taught me about free software, much as a bird might teach an airplane
about flying.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="For the second edition (2017)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="acknowledgements-2nd-ed"></a>For the second edition (2017)</h3></div></div></div><p>The acknowledgements for the second edition of this book include
more people and, undoubtedly, more unintentional omissions.  If your
name should be here but is not, please accept my apologies (and let me
know, because we can at least fix the online copy).</p><p>Andy Oram of O'Reilly Media once again went above and beyond the
call of duty as an editor.  He read closely and made many excellent
recommendations; his expertise both in expository writing in general
and in open source in particular were apparent in all his comments.  I
can't thank him enough, and the book is much improved for his
attention.</p><p>James Vasile has been my friend and colleague for some years
now, yet not a week goes in which I don't learn something new from
him.  Despite having a busy job &#8212; I know firsthand,
because we're business partners &#8212; and young children at
home, he unhesitatingly volunteered to read through the manuscript and
provide feedback.  Money can't buy that, and even if it could, I could
never afford James.  Thanks, pal.</p><p>Cecilia Donnelly is both a wonderful friend and a supremely
capable Open Source Specialist at the Open Tech Strategies office in
Chicago.  It's a delight to be working with her, as our clients know
too, and her clear thinking and sharp observations have influenced
many parts of this book.</p><p>Karen Sandler has been unfailingly supportive, and provided
thoughtful and patient discussion about many of the topics (and even
some of the specific examples) in this book.  As with James, I usually
learn something from Karen when we talk about free software, and when
we talk about other things too.</p><p>Bradley Kuhn's name appears several times in the commit logs for
this book, because he provided highly expert feedback on multiple
occasions, in one case practically writing the patch himself.  As I
wrote in the log message for one of the commits, he is someone "whose
contributions to free software have been immeasurable and whose
dedication to our shared cause is a constant inspiration".</p><p>Karen and Bradley both work at the Software Freedom Conservancy
(<a class="ulink" href="https://sfconservancy.org/" target="_top">https://sfconservancy.org/</a>).
If you like this book and you want to help free software, donating to
the Conservancy is fine first step.  It's also a fine second
step.</p><p>Ben Reser provided a super-detailed and expert review of Chapters
6 and 7 that resulted in many improvements.  Ben, thank you so much.</p><p>Michael Bernstein not only provided some detailed feedback
during the interregnum between the first and second editions, he also
helped a lot with organizing the Kickstarter campaign that made the
latter possible.  Thank you, Michael.</p><p>Danese Cooper always keeps me on my toes, and in particular
brought me the message (which I was not at first willing to hear) that
innersourcing <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> work as a means of helping
organizations learn open source practices and eventually produce open
source software themselves.  Thanks for that, Danese, and much
else.</p><p>Between the two editions, I spent a very educational stretch of
time working at O'Reilly Media, Code for America / Civic Commons
(while ensconsed in the Open Plans office in New York City, thanks to
their very kind offer of desk space), and the New America Foundation
as Open Internet Tools Project Fellow.  Much of what I learned through
that work ended up in the book, and in addition to the organizations
themselves I thank Tim O'Reilly, Jen Pahlka, Andrew McLaughlin, Philip
Ashlock, Abhi Nemani, Nick Grossman, Chris Holmes, Frank Hebbert, and
Andrew Hoppin for the ideas and perspectives they shared.</p><p>Sumana Harihareswara and Leonard Richardson have given frank and
helpful commentary about various open source goings-on over the years;
the book is better for their input, and I am the better for their
friendship.</p><p>Eben Moglen at the Software Freedom Law Center (<a class="ulink" href="https://softwarefreedom.org/" target="_top">https://softwarefreedom.org/</a>)
taught me a lot about how to look at free software as a large-scale
social and economic phenomenon, and about how companies view free
software.  He also provided a private working space on a few occasions
when it really made a difference.  Thank you, Eben.</p><p>I do not understand how Dr. David A. Wheeler makes time to
answer my occasional questions when he is in demand from so many other
people as well, but he does, and his answers are always spot-on and
authoritative.  Thanks as always, David.</p><p>Breena Xie's interest in open source led swiftly to trenchant
questions about it.  Those questions were helpful to me, in thinking
through certain topics in the book, but so was her patience on those
occasions when the book demanded more time than it should have (by
which I mean "than I said it would").  Thank you, Breena.</p><p>Many thanks to Radhir Kothuri and the rest of the HackIllinois
2017 crew, who provided a very timely motivational boost when they
proposed doing a print run of the new edition for their event at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Illinois in February 2017.
I appreciate the vote of confidence in the book, and hope the
HackIllinois attendees will be pleased with the results.</p><p>Camille Bégnis of <a class="ulink" href="http://neodoc.biz/" target="_top">http://neodoc.biz/</a> provided expert DocBook help in real time
one day, solving a long-standing technical problem in the online
version of the book that I'd been unable to fix for years.  Merci
beaucoup, Camille.</p><p>The hardest part of these acknowledgements is realizing there
will never be enough space to do justice to all the knowledge people
have shared in the decade since the first edition came out.  I've been
working in open source the whole time since then, and have had
illuminating conversations with many clients, partners, interviewees,
expert consultants, and fellow travelers; some of them have
occasionally sent in concrete improvements to the book, too.  I can't
imagine what this new edition would be without the benefit of that
collective mind, and will try to list some of those people below.  I'm
sure the list is incomplete, and I apologize for that.  For what it's
worth, I used a program to randomize the order, and accepted its first
output:</p><p>

</p><p>The 2nd edition rewrite was funded through a Kickstarter
campaign.  The response to that campaign was swift and generous, and
I'm immensely grateful to all the people who pledged.  I hope they
will forgive me for taking almost four times longer than expected to
finish the revisions.  Every backer of the campaign is acknowledged
below, using the name they provided via Kickstarter.  The list is in
either ascending or descending order by pledge size, but I'm not going
to say which, because a little mystery should be retained in these
matters:</p><p>
