source project.  From the point of view of the project's volunteers,
it's the most visible and glamorous part.  This unfortunately means
that other activities, such as documentation, formal testing, etc., can
sometimes be neglected, at least compared to the amount of attention
they often receive in proprietary software.  Corporate organizations
are sometimes able to make up for this, by devoting some of their
internal software development infrastructure to open source
projects.</p><p>The key to doing this successfully is to translate between the
company's internal processes and those of the public development
community.  Such translation is not effortless: often the two are not
a close match, and the differences can only be bridged via human
intervention.  For example, the company may use a different bug
tracker than the public project.  Even if they use the same tracking
software, the data stored in it will be very different, because the
bug-tracking needs of a company are very different from those of a
free software community.  A piece of information that starts in one
tracker may need to be reflected in the other, with confidential
portions removed or, in the other direction, added.</p><p>The sections that follow are about how to build and maintain
such bridges.  The end result should be that the open source project
runs more smoothly, the community recognizes the company's investment
of resources, and yet does not feel that the company is
inappropriately steering things toward its own goals.</p><div class="sect2" title="Control de calidad (i.e., Examinación profesional)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="subsidize-qa"></a>Control de calidad (i.e., Examinación profesional)</h3></div></div></div><p>In proprietary software development, it is normal to have teams
of people dedicated solely to quality assurance: bug hunting,
performance and scalability testing, interface and documentation
checking, etc.  As a rule, these activities are not pursued as
vigorously by the volunteer community on a free software project.
This is partly because it's hard to get volunteer labor for
unglamorous work like testing, partly because people tend to assume
that having a large user community gives the project good testing
coverage, and, in the case of performance and scalability testing,
partly because volunteers often don't have access to the necessary
hardware resources anyway.</p><p>The assumption that having many users is equivalent to having
many testers is not entirely baseless.  Certainly there's little point
assigning testers for basic functionality in common environments: bugs
there will quickly be found by users in the natural course of things.
But because users are just trying to get work done, they do not
consciously set out to explore uncharted edge cases in the program's
functionality, and are likely to leave certain classes of bugs
unfound.  Furthermore, when they discover a bug with an easy
workaround, they often silently implement the workaround without
bothering to report the bug.  Most insidiously, the usage patterns of
your customers (the people who drive <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
interest in the software) may differ in statistically significant ways
from the usage patterns of the Average User In The Street.</p><p>A professional testing team can uncover these sorts of bugs, and
can do so as easily with free software as with proprietary software.
The challenge is to convey the testing team's results back to the
public in a useful form.  In-house testing departments usually have
their own way of reporting test results, involving company-specific
jargon, or specialized knowledge about particular customers and their
data sets.  Such reports would be inappropriate for the public bug
tracker, both because of their form and because of confidentiality
concerns.  Even if your company's internal bug tracking software
were the same as that used by the public project, management might
need to make company-specific comments and metadata changes to the
issues (for example, to raise an issue's internal priority, or
schedule its resolution for a particular customer).  Usually such
notes are confidential&#8212;sometimes they're not even shown to the
customer.  But even when they're not confidential, they're of no
concern to the public project, and therefore the public should not be
distracted with them.</p><p>Yet the core bug report itself <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important
to the public.  In fact, a bug report from your testing department is
in some ways more valuable than one received from users at large,
since the testing department probes for things that other users won't.
Given that you're unlikely to get that particular bug report from any
other source, you definitely want to preserve it and make it
available to the public project.</p><p>To do this, either the QA department can file issues directly in
the public issue tracker, if they're comfortable with that, or an
intermediary (usually one of the developers) can "translate" the
testing department's internal reports into new issues in the public
tracker.  Translation simply means describing the bug in a way that
makes no reference to customer-specific information (the reproduction
recipe may use customer data, assuming the customer approves it, of
course).</p><p>It is somewhat preferable to have the QA department filing
issues in the public tracker directly.  That gives the public a more
direct appreciation of your company's involvement with the project:
useful bug reports add to your organization's credibility just as any
technical contribution would.  It also gives developers a direct line
of communication to the testing team.  For example, if the internal QA
team is monitoring the public issue tracker, a developer can commit a
fix for a scalability bug (which the developer may not have the
resources to test herself), and then add a note to the issue asking
the QA team to see if the fix had the desired effect.  Expect a bit of
resistance from some of the developers; programmers have a tendency to
regard QA as, at best, a necessary evil.  The QA team can easily
overcome this by finding significant bugs and filing comprehensible
reports; on the other hand, if their reports are not at least as good
as those coming from the regular user community, then there's no point
having them interact directly with the development team.</p><p>Either way, once a public issue exists, the original internal
issue should simply reference the public issue for technical content.
Management and paid developers may continue to annotate the internal
issue with company-specific comments as necessary, but use the public
issue for information that should be available to everyone.</p><p>You should go into this process expecting extra overhead.
Maintaining two issues for one bug is, naturally, more work than
maintaining one issue.  The benefit is that many more coders will see
the report and be able to contribute to a solution.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Aviso legal y protecciones"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="subsidize-legal"></a>Aviso legal y protecciones</h3></div></div></div><p>Corporaciones, con y sin fines de lucro, son las únicas entidades 
  que ponen atención de problemas legales complejos en el software libre.
  Desarrolladores individuales usualmente entienden las molestias de
  diferentes licencias abiertas, pero generalmente no tienen el tiempo o 
  recursos de seguir los derechos de autor, trademark, y leyes de 
  patentes en detalles. Si su compañia tiene un departamento legal, puede
  ayudar al proyecto vetando el estatus de copyright del códgio, y 
  ayudar a desarrolladores entender posibles patentes y problemas de 
  trademark. Las formas exactas que esta ayuda puede tomar es discutidas
  en <a class="xref" href="legal.html" title="Capítulo 9. Licencias, Copyrights y Patentes">Capítulo 9, <i>Licencias, Copyrights y Patentes</i></a>.  Lo más importante es asegurarse que la
  comunicación entre el departamente legal y la comunidad de desarrollo,
   si pasan del todo, aparece con apreciación mutua de diferentes 
   universos de donde vienen las partes. En ocaciones, estos dos grupos
   hablan de más, cada parte asumen saber más sobre partes especificas
   más que el otro y que el otro carece. Una buena estrategia es de tener
   un moderador (usualmente un desarrollador, o un abogado con expertise
   técnico) que se plante en medio y tradusca lo que sea necesario.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Documentación y Usabilidad"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="subsidize-documentation-usability"></a>Documentación y Usabilidad</h3></div></div></div><p>Documentation and usability are both famous weak spots in open
source projects, although I think, at least in the case of
documentation, that the difference between free and proprietary
software is frequently exaggerated.  Nevertheless, it is empirically
true that much open source software lacks first-class documentation
and usability research.</p><p>If your organization wants to help fill these gaps for a
project, probably the best thing it can do is hire people who
are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> regular developers on the project, but
who will be able to interact productively with the developers.
Not hiring regular developers is good for two reasons: one, that way
you don't take development time away from the project; two, those
closest to the software are usually the wrong people to write
documentation or investigate usability anyway, because they have
trouble seeing the software from an outsider's point of view.</p><p>However, it will still be necessary for whoever works on these
problems to communicate with the developers.  Find people who are
technical enough to talk to the coding team, but not so expert in the
software that they can't empathize with regular users anymore.</p><p>A medium-level user is probably the right person to write good
documentation.  In fact, after the first edition of this book was
published, I received the following email from an open source
developer named Dirk Reiners:</p><pre class="screen">
One comment on Money::Documentation and Usability: when we had some 
money to spend and decided that a beginner's tutorial was the most 
critical piece that we needed we hired a medium-level user to write it. 
He had gone through the induction to the system recently enough to 
remember the problems, but he had gotten past them so he knew how to 
describe them. That allowed him to write something that needed only 
minor fixes by the core developers for the things that he hadn't gotten 
right, but still covering the 'obvious' stuff devs would have missed.

His case was even better, as it had been his job to introduce a bunch of 
other people (students) to the system, so he combined the experience of 
many people, which is something that was just a lucky occurrence and is 
probably hard to get in most cases.

sites (see
<a class="xref" href="web-site.html#canned-hosting" title="Hosting Enlatado">&#8220;Hosting Enlatado&#8221;</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="technical-infrastructure.html" title="Capítulo 3. Infraestructura Técnica">Capítulo 3, <i>Infraestructura Técnica</i></a></span>), providing a
server and network connection&#8212;and most importantly, system
administration help&#8212;can be of significant assistance.  Even if
this is all your organization does for the project, it can be a
moderately effective way to obtain good public relations karma, though
it will not bring any influence over the direction of the
project.</p><p>You can probably expect a banner ad or an acknowledgment on the
project's home page, thanking your company for providing hosting.  If
you set up the hosting so that the project's web address is under your
company's domain name, then you will get some additional association
just through the URL.  This will cause most users to think of the
software as having <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> to do with your
company, even if you don't contribute to development at all.  The
problem is, the developers are aware of this associative tendency too,
and may not be very comfortable with having the project in your domain
unless you're contributing more resources than just bandwidth.  After
all, there are a lot of places to host these days.  The community may
eventually feel that the implied misallocation of credit is not worth
the convenience brought by hosting, and take the project elsewhere.
So if you want to provide hosting, do so&#8212;but either plan to get
even more involved soon, or be circumspect about how much involvement
you claim.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="contracting.html">Anterior</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="money.html">Subir</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="marketing.html">Siguiente</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Contrataciones </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Inicio</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Marketing</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
