discussion (by setting the <code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> header).

Subject: [ANN] Scanley full-text indexer project
Reply-to: dev@scanley.org

This is a one-time post to announce the creation of the Scanley
project, an open source full-text indexer and search engine with a
rich API, for use by programmers in providing search services for
large collections of text files.  Scanley is now running code, is
under active development, and is looking for both developers and
testers.

Home page: http://www.scanley.org/

Features:
   - Searches plain text, HTML, and XML
   - Word or phrase searching
   - (planned) Fuzzy matching
   - (planned) Incremental updating of indexes
   - (planned) Indexing of remote web sites

Requirements:
   - Python 2.2 or higher
   - Enough disk space to hold the indexes (approximately 2x
     original data size)

For more information, please come to scanley.org.

Thank you,
-J. Random

in <a class="xref" href="communications.html" title="Bab 6. Komunikasi">Bab 6, <i>Komunikasi</i></a></span> for advice on announcing
further releases and other project events.)</p><p>There is an ongoing debate in the free software world about
whether it is necessary to begin with running code, or whether a
project can benefit from being opened even during the
design/discussion stage.  I used to think starting with running code
was the most important factor, that it was what separated successful
projects from toys, and that serious developers would only be
attracted to software that did something concrete already.</p><p>This turned out not to be the case.  In the Subversion project,
we started with a design document, a core of interested and
well-connected developers, a lot of fanfare, and
<span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> running code at all.  To my complete surprise,
the project acquired active participants right from the beginning, and
by the time we did have something running, there were quite a few
volunteer developers already deeply involved.  Subversion is not the
only example; the Mozilla project was also launched without running
code, and is now a successful and popular web browser.</p><p>In the face of such evidence, I have to back away from the
assertion that running code is absolutely necessary for launching a
project.  Running code is still the best foundation for success, and a
good rule of thumb would be to wait until you have it before
announcing your project.  However, there may be circumstances where
announcing earlier makes sense.  I do think that at least a
well-developed design document, or else some sort of code framework,
is necessary&#8212;of course it may be revised based on public
feedback, but there has to be something concrete, something more
tangible than just good intentions, for people to sink their teeth
into.</p><p>Whenever you announce, don't expect a horde of volunteers to
join the project immediately afterward.  Usually, the result of
announcing is that you get a few casual inquiries, a few more people
join your mailing lists, and aside from that, everything continues
pretty much as before.  But over time, you will notice a gradual
increase in participation from both new code contributors and users.
Announcement is merely the planting of a seed.  It can take a long
time for the news to spread.  If the project consistently rewards
those who get involved, the news <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> spread,
though, because people want to share when they've found something
good.  If all goes well, the dynamics of exponential communications
networks will slowly transform the project into a complex community,
where you don't necessarily know everyone's name and can no longer
follow every single conversation.  The next chapters are about working
in that environment.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="setting-tone.html">Sebelumnya</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="getting-started.html">Induk</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="technical-infrastructure.html">Lanjut</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Setting the Tone </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Depan</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Bab 3.
