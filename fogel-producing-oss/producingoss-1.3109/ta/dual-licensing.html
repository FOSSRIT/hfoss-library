scheme, in which proprietary derivative works may pay the copyright
holder for the right to use the code, but the code still remains free
for use by open source projects.  This tends to work better with code
libraries than with standalone applications, naturally.  The exact
terms differ from case to case.  Usually the license for the free side
is the GNU GPL, since it already bars others from incorporating the
covered code into their proprietary product without permission from
the copyright holder.  An example is the MySQL license,
described at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/licensing/" target="_top">mysql.com/company/legal/licensing</a>.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>15 June 2013: If you're reading this note, then
you've encountered this section while it's undergoing substantial
revision; see <a class="ulink" href="http://producingoss.com/v2.html" target="_top">producingoss.com/v2.html</a> for details.</em></span></p><p>poss2 todo: Note how that page, and so many other dual-licensing
pages, refer to the proprietary license as "commercial".  Need a
subsection here about why it's important <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to
call it that.</p><p>You might be wondering: how can the copyright holder offer
proprietary licensing for a mandatory fee if the terms of the GNU GPL
stipulate that the code must be available under less restrictive
terms?  The answer is that the GPL's terms are something the copyright
holder imposes on everyone else; the owner is therefore free to
decide <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to apply those terms to itself.  A
good way to think of it is to imagine that the copyright owner has an
infinite number of copies of the software stored in a bucket.  Each
time it takes one out of the bucket to send into the world, it can
decide what license to put on it: GPL, proprietary, or something else.
Its right to do this is not tied to the GPL or any other open source
license; it is simply a power granted by copyright law.</p><p>The attractiveness of dual licensing is that, at its best, it
provides a way for a free software project to get a reliable income
stream.  Unfortunately, it can also interfere with the normal dynamics
of open source projects.  The problem is that any volunteer who makes
a code contribution is now contributing to two distinct entities: the
free version of the code and the proprietary version.  While the
contributor will be comfortable contributing to the free version,
since that's the norm in open source projects, she may feel funny
about contributing to someone else's semi-proprietary revenue stream.
The awkwardness is exacerbated by the fact that in dual licensing, the
copyright owner really needs to gather formal, signed copyright
assignments from all contributors, in order to protect itself from a
disgruntled contributor later claiming a percentage of royalties from
the proprietary stream.  The process of collecting these assignment
papers means that contributors are starkly confronted with the fact
that they are doing work that makes money for someone else.</p><p>Not all volunteers will be bothered by this; after all, their
contributions go into the open source edition as well, and that may be
where their main interest lies.  Nevertheless, dual licensing is an
instance of the copyright holder assigning itself a special right that
others in the project do not have, and is thus bound to raise
tensions at some point, at least with some volunteers.</p><p>What seems to happen in practice is that companies based on
dual licensed software do not have truly egalitarian development
communities.  They get small-scale bug fixes and cleanup patches from
external sources, but end up doing most of the hard work with internal
resources.  For example, Zack Urlocker, then vice president of marketing at
MySQL, told me that the company generally ends up hiring the most
active volunteers anyway.  Thus, although the product itself is open
source, licensed under the GPL, its development is more or less
controlled by the company, albeit with the (extremely unlikely)
possibility that someone truly dissatisfied with the company's
handling of the software could fork the project.  To what degree this
threat preëmptively shapes the company's policies I don't know,
but at any rate, MySQL does not seem to be having acceptance problems
either in the open source world or beyond.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="contributor-agreements.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="legal.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="patents.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Contributor Agreements </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Patents</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
