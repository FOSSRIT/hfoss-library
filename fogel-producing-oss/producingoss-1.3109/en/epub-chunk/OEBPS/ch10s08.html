free software, because they pose the only real threat against which
the free software community cannot defend itself.  Copyright and
trademark problems can always be gotten around.  If part of your code
looks like it may infringe on someone else's copyright, you can just
rewrite that part while continuing to use the same underlying
algorithm.  If it turns out someone has a trademark on your
project's name, at the very worst you can just rename the project.
Although changing names would be a temporary inconvenience, it
wouldn't matter in the long run, since the code itself would still do
what it always did.</p><p>But a patent is a blanket injunction against implementing a
certain idea.  It doesn't matter who writes the code, nor even what
programming language is used.  Once someone has accused a free
software project of infringing a patent, the project must either stop
implementing that particular feature, or expose the project
<span class="emphasis"><em>and its users</em></span> to expensive and
time-consuming lawsuits.  Since the instigators of such lawsuits are
usually corporations with deep pockets—that's who has the
resources and inclination to acquire patents in the first
place—most free software projects cannot afford either to defend
themselves nor to indemnify their users, and must capitulate
immediately even if they think it
highly likely that the patent would be unenforceable in court.  To
avoid getting into such a situation in the first place, free software
projects have sometimes had to code defensively, avoiding patented
algorithms in advance even when they are the best or only available
solution to a programming problem.</p><p>Surveys and anecdotal evidence show that not only the vast
majority of open source programmers, but a majority
of <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> programmers, think that software patents
should be abolished entirely.<sup>[<a id="idp10087744" href="#ftn.idp10087744" class="footnote">86</a>]</sup> Open source programmers tend to feel
particularly strongly about it, and may refuse to work on projects
that are too closely associated with the collection or enforcement of
software patents.  If your organization collects software patents,
then make it clear, in a public and irrevocable way, that the patents
would never be enforced when the infringement comes from open source
code, and that the patents are 
only to be used as a defense in case some other party initiates an
infringement suit against your organization.  This is not only the
right thing to do, it's also good open source public relations.<sup>[<a id="idp10089696" href="#ftn.idp10089696" class="footnote">87</a>]</sup></p><p>Unfortunately, collecting patents purely for defensive purposes
is rational.  The current patent system, at least in the United
States, is by its nature an arms race: if your competitors have
acquired a lot of patents, then your best defense is to acquire a lot
of patents yourself, so that if you're ever hit with a patent
infringement suit you can respond with a similar threat—then the
two parties usually sit down and work out a cross-licensing deal so
that neither of them has to pay anything, except to their patent 
lawyers of course.</p><p>The harm done to free software by software patents is more
insidious than just direct threats to code development, however.
Software patents encourage an atmosphere of secrecy among firmware
designers, who justifiably worry that by publishing details of their
interfaces they will be making it easier for competitors to find ways
to slap them with patent infringement suits.  This is not just a
theoretical danger; it has apparently been happening for a long time
in the video card industry, for example.  Many video card
manufacturers are reluctant to release the detailed programming
specifications needed to produce high-performance open source drivers
for their cards, thus making it impossible for free operating systems
to support those cards to their full potential.  Why would the
manufacturers withold these specs?  It doesn't make sense for them to
work <span class="emphasis"><em>against</em></span> software support; after all,
compatibility with more operating systems can only mean more card
sales.  But it turns out that, behind the design room door, these
shops are all violating one another's patents, sometimes knowingly and
sometimes accidentally.  The patents are so unpredictable and so
potentially broad that no card manufacturer can ever be certain it's
safe, even after doing a patent search.  Thus, manufacturers dare not
publish their full interface specifications, since that would make it
much easier for competitors to figure out whether any patents are
being infringed.  (Of course, the nature of this situation is such
that you will not find a written admission from a primary source that
it is going on; I learned it through a personal communication.)</p><p>Modern free software licenses generally have clauses to combat,
or at least mitigate, the dangers arising from software patents.
Usually these clauses work by automatically revoking the overall open
source license for any party who makes a patent infringement claim
based on either the work as a whole<sup>[<a id="idp10096176" href="#ftn.idp10096176" class="footnote">88</a>]</sup>,
or based on the claimant's code contributions to the project.  But
though it is useful, both legally and politically, to build patent
defenses into free software licenses in this way, in the end these
protections are not be enough to dispel the chilling effect that the
threat of patent lawsuits has on free software.  Only changes in the
substance or interpretation of international patent law will do
that.</p><p>Recent developments, such as the 2014 decision by the
U.S. Supreme Court against the patentability of abstract ideas, in
<em class="citetitle">Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank</em> (<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Corp._v._CLS_Bank_International">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Corp._v._CLS_Bank_International</a>),
have made the future of software patents unpredictable.  But there is
so much money to be extracted via infringement claims, in particular
by <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">patent
trolls</a> but in general by any entity with a large patent
portfolio and a lack of other revenue sources, that I am not
optimistic this fight will be over any time soon.  If you want to
learn more about the problem, there are good links at <a class="ulink" href="http://endsoftpatents.org/">endsoftpatents.org/</a> and in
the Wikipedia article <a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_patent</a>.  I've also written
some blog posts summarizing the arguments against software patents,
collected at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.rants.org/patent-posts/">www.rants.org/patent-posts</a>.  As of this writing it's been
about six years since the main posts there were published, but all the
reasons why software patents are a bad idea are just as true now as
they were then.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp10087744" href="#idp10087744" class="para">86</a>] </sup>See
