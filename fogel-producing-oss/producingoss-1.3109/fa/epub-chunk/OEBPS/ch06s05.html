project is getting people to be thoughtful about which forum they
choose for different kinds of communications.  It's tricky partly
because it's not immediately obvious that it matters.  During any
given conversation, the participants are mostly concerned with what
the people involved are saying, and won't usually stop to think about
whether or not the forum itself gives others who
<span class="emphasis"><em>might</em></span> want to take part the opportunity to do
so.</p><p>For example, a real-time forum like IRC is terrific for quick
questions, for opportunistic synchronization of work, for reminding
someone of something they promised to do, etc.  But it's not a good
forum for making decisions that affect the whole project, because the
people who take part in a conversation in IRC are just whoever
happened to be in the channel at that moment — it's
very dependent on work schedules, time zones, etc.  On the other hand,
the development mailing list is a great place for making formal
project-wide decisions, since every interested party will have an
opportunity to see and respond to the relevant posts, even though it's
not as well-suited to quick, real-time interactions as IRC is.</p><p>Another example comes up frequently in bug tracker usage,
especially in the last few years as bug trackers have become so well
integrated with email.  Sometimes people will be drawn into a
discussion in a bug ticket<sup>[<a id="idp7682016" href="#ftn.idp7682016" class="footnote">44</a>]</sup> and because they simply see project-related
emails coming in to their email client, they treat the discussion as
though it's happening on the real development list.  But it's not:
anyone who wasn't watching that bug and wasn't explicitly invited into
the conversation won't even be aware it's happening.  If things are
discussed in that bug ticket that go beyond the scope of just that one
bug, they'll be discussed without input from people who should at
least have had a chance to participate.</p><p>The solution to this is to encourage conscious, intentional
forum changes.  If a discussion starts to get into questions beyond
the scope of its original forum, then at some point someone involved
should ask that the conversation move over to the main development
list or some other wider forum.</p><p>It's not enough for you to do this on your own.  You have to
create a culture where it's normal for everyone to do it, so everyone
thinks about forum appropriateness as a matter of course, and feels
comfortable raising questions of forum whenever necessary in any
discussion.  Obviously, documenting the practice will help (see <a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html" title="Writing It All Down">

      “Writing It All Down”
    </a><span> in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="فصل 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">
      فصل 4, <em>Social and Political Infrastructure</em></a></span>), but you'll probably also
need to remind people of it often, especially when your project is
starting out.  A good rule of thumb is: if the conversation looks
convergent, then it's okay to keep it in the bug ticket or other
original forum.  But if it looks likely to diverge for a while (e.g.,
widening into philosophical issues about how the software should
behave, or raising design issues that go beyond just the one bug)
before it converges, then take the discussion to a broader forum,
usually the development mailing list.</p><div class="sect2" title="Cross-Link Between Forums"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="cross-links"/>Cross-Link Between Forums</h2></div></div></div><p>When a discussion moves from one place to another, cross-link
between the old and new place.  For example, if discussion moves from
the ticket tracker to the mailing list, link to the mailing list
thread from the ticket, and mention the original ticket at the start
of the new list thread.  It's important for someone following the
ticket to be able to reach the later discussion; it's also important
for someone who encounters the ticket a year later to be able to
follow to where the conversation went to in the mailing list archives.
The person who does the move may find this cross-linking slightly
laborious, but open source is fundamentally a writer-responsible
culture.  It's more important to make things easy for the tens or
hundreds of people who may read the bug than for the three or five
people writing about it.</p><p>It's also fine to take important conclusions or summaries from
the list discussion and paste them into the ticket at the end, if that
will make things convenient for readers.  A common idiom is to move
discussion to the mailing list, put a link to that thread in the
ticket, and then when the discussion finishes, paste the final summary
into the ticket (along with a link to the message containing that
summary), so someone browsing the ticket later can easily see what
conclusion was reached without having to click to somewhere else or do
detective work.  Note that the usual "two masters" data duplication
problem does not exist here, because both archives and ticket comments
are usually static, unchangeable data anyway.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp7682016" href="#idp7682016" class="para">44</a>] </sup>For example, on GitHub,
simply mentioning someone's GitHub account name with an @-sign (e.g.,
