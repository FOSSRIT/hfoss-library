<em class="firstterm">proprietary relicensing</em>
scheme<sup>[<a id="idm4321" href="#ftn.idm4321" class="footnote">105</a>]</sup>, in which an open source version of the
software is available under the usual open source terms, while a
proprietary version is available for a fee.</p><p>Why would anyone want a proprietary version, when an open source
version is already out there?  There are two separate answers,
reflecting the two different types of proprietary relicensing.</p><p>The first kind is about <em class="firstterm">selling
exceptions</em> to copyleft requirements, and is typically used
with code libraries rather than with standalone applications.  The way
it works is that the library's owner (i.e., copyright holder), seeing
that some of the library's users want to incorporate it into their own
proprietary applications, sells them a promise to
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> enforce the redistribution requirements of
the open source version's license.  This only works when the open
source code is under a copyleft-style license, of
course — in practice it is usually the GPL or
AGPL.</p><p>With this promise in hand, the downstream users can use the
library in their proprietary product without worry that they might be
forced to share the source code to their full product under the copyleft
license.  One well-known example of "selling exceptions" is the MySQL
database engine, which is distributed under the GPL version 2, but
with a proprietary license offering available for many years, first
from the Swedish company MySQL AB, and later from Oracle, Inc, which
purchased MySQL AB in 2008.</p><p>The second kind of proprietary relicensing, sometimes called the
<em class="firstterm">freemium</em> or <em class="firstterm">open core</em>
model, uses an open source version to
drive sales of a presumably fancier proprietary version (see
<a class="xref" href="ch05s10.html#commercial-vs-proprietary" title="&quot;Commercial&quot; vs &quot;Proprietary&quot;">the section called “"Commercial" vs "Proprietary"”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency">Chapter 5, <em>Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency</em></a></span> for a discussion of some
marketing pitfalls to avoid in this situation).  Usually the
company offering the proprietary version is also the primary
maintainer of the open source version, in the sense of supplying most
of the developer attention (this is usually inevitable, for reasons
we'll get to in a moment).  Furthermore, although in theory the
company <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> offer paid support for both the
open source and proprietary versions<sup>[<a id="idm4336" href="#ftn.idm4336" class="footnote">106</a>]</sup>,
in practice they almost
always offer it only for the proprietary version, because then they
can charge two fees: a subscription fee for the software itself and a
fee for the support services, with only the latter having any marginal
cost to the supplier.</p><p>You might be wondering: how can the copyright holder offer the
software under a proprietary license if the terms of the GNU GPL
stipulate that the code must be available under less restrictive
terms?  The answer is that the GPL's terms are something the copyright
holder imposes on everyone else; the owner is therefore free to decide
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to apply those terms to itself.  In other
words, one always has the right to not sue one's self for copyright
infringement.  This right is not tied to the GPL or any other open
source license; it is simply in the nature of copyright law.</p><div class="sect2" title="Problems with Proprietary Relicensing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="proprietary-relicensing-problems"/>Problems with Proprietary Relicensing</h2></div></div></div><p>Proprietary relicensing, of both varieties, tends to suffer from
several problems.</p><p>First, it discourages the normal dynamics of open source
projects, because any code contributors from outside the company are
now effectively contributing to two distinct entities: the free
version of the code and the proprietary version.  While the
contributor will be comfortable helping the free version, since that's
the norm in open source projects, she may feel less enthusiastic about
her contributions being useable in a monopolized proprietary product.
That is, unlike a straight non-copyleft license by which anyone has
the right to use the code as part of a proprietary work, here only
<span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> party has that right, and other participants
in the project are thus being asked to contribute to an asymmetric
result.  This awkwardness is reflected and in some ways amplified by
the fact that in a proprietary relicensing scheme, the copyright owner
must collect some kind of formal agreement from each contributor (see
<a class="xref" href="ch09s05.html" title="Contributor Agreements">the section called “Contributor Agreements”</a> earlier in this chapter), in
order to have the right to redistribute that contributor's code under
a proprietary license.  Because such an agreement needs to give the
collecting entity special, one-sided rights that a typical open source
contributor agreement doesn't include, the process of collecting
agreements starkly confronts contributors with the imbalance of the
situation, and some of them may decline to sign.  (Remember, they
don't need to sign a contribution agreement in order to distribute
their own changes along with the original code; rather, the
<span class="emphasis"><em>company</em></span> needs the agreement in order to
redistribute the contributor's changes, especially under a proprietary
license.  Asymmetry cuts both ways.)</p><p>Historically, many companies that have started out offering a
seemingly clear proprietary relicensing option — use
our product under open source terms, or buy a proprietary license so
you can use it under proprietary terms — eventually
graduated to something closer to a "shakedown" model instead, in which
anyone who makes commercially significant use of the code ends up
being pressured to purchase a proprietary license as a way of
protecting their commercial revenue stream from harassment.  The
precise legal bases on which this pressure rests differ from case to
case, but the overall pattern of behavior has been remarkably
consistent.</p><p>Naturally, neither the companies initiating these shakedowns nor
the parties who are its targets, most of whom eventually capitulate,
have anything to gain from going on the record about it, so I can only
tell you that I have heard of it informally and off-the-record from
multiple sources, at different projects and different companies.
One reason I generally advise companies who are serious about open
source development to stay away from proprietary relicensing is that,
if history is a reliable guide, the temptation to undermine the open
source license will be overwhelming to the point of being impossible
to resist.</p><p>Finally, there is a deep motivational problem for open source
projects that operate in the shadow of a proprietarily relicensed
version: the sense that most of the salaried development attention is
going to the proprietary version anyway, and that therefore spending
time contributing to the open source version is a fool's
game — that one is just helping a commercial entity
free up its own developers to work on features that the open source
community will never see.  This fear is reasonable on its face, but it
also becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more outside developers
stay away, the company sees less reason to invest in the open source
codebase, because they're not getting a community multiplier effect
anyway.  Their disengagement in turn discourages outside developers,
and so on.</p><p>What seems to happen in practice is that companies that offer
proprietarily relicensed software do not get truly active development
communities with external participants.  They get occasional
small-scale bug fixes and cleanup patches from the outside, but end up
doing most of the hard work with internal resources.  Since this book
is about running free software projects, I will just say that in my
experience, proprietary relicensing schemes inevitably have a negative
effect on the level of community engagement and the level of technical
quality on the open source side.  If you conclude that for business
reasons you want to try it anyway, then I hope this section will at
least help you mitigate some of those effects.<sup>[<a id="app-store-terms-and-proprietary-relicensing" href="#ftn.app-store-terms-and-proprietary-relicensing" class="footnote">107</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm4321" href="#idm4321" class="para">105</a>] </sup>This is sometimes also called <em class="firstterm">dual

historically also referred to releasing open source software under two
or more open source licenses simultaneously.  I am grateful to Bradley

term.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm4336" href="#idm4336" class="para">106</a>] </sup>In both cases hosted

terms-of-service agreements for online software distribution
services — the Apple App Store, for
example — effectively force you to use proprietary
relicensing if you want to distribute copylefted software.  I won't go
into detail here, but if you're distributing GPL-licensed or other
copylefted code from a place that restricts users from redistributing
what they download, you may be in this situation.  For more
