significantly from trademark law as applied elsewhere.  This sometimes
surprises people: they think that if the code can be copied freely,
then that can't possibly be consistent with some entity controlling a
trademark on the project's name or logo.  It is consistent, however,
and below I'll explain why, furnishing some examples.</p><p>First, understand what trademarks are about: they are about
truth in labeling and, to some degree, endorsement.  A trademarked
name or symbol is a way for an entity &#8212; the entity who
owns or controls that trademark &#8212; to signal, in an
easily recognizeable way, that they approve of a particular product.
Often they are signaling their approval because they are the source of
the product, and purchases of that product provide a revenue stream
for them.  But that is not the only circumstance under which someone
might want to enforce accurate attribution.  For example,
certification marks are trademarked names or symbols that an entity
applies to <span class="emphasis"><em>someone else's</em></span> product, in order to
signal that the product meets the certifying entity's
standards.</p><p>Importantly, <span class="emphasis"><em>trademarks do not restrict copying,
modification, or redistribution</em></span>.  I cannot emphasize this
enough: trademark is unrelated to copyright, and does not govern the
same actions that copyright governs.  Trademark is about what you may
publicly call things, not about what you may do with those things nor
with whom you may share them.</p><p>One famous example of trademark enforcement in free and open
source software demonstrates these distinctions clearly.</p><div class="sect2" title="Case study: Mozilla Firefox, the Debian Project, and Iceweasel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="mozilla-firefox-debian-iceweasel"></a>Case study: Mozilla Firefox, the Debian Project, and Iceweasel</h3></div></div></div><p>The Mozilla Foundation owns the trademarked name "Firefox",
which it uses to refer to its popular free software web browser of the
same name.  The Debian Project, which maintains a long-running and
also quite popular GNU/Linux distribution, wanted to package Firefox
for users of Debian GNU/Linux.</p><p>So far, so good: Debian does not need Mozilla's permission to
package Firefox, since Firefox is open source software.  However,
Debian does need Mozilla's permission to <span class="emphasis"><em>call</em></span> the
packaged browser "Firefox" and to use the widely-recognized Firefox
logo (you've probably seen it: a long reddish fox curling its body and
tail around a blue globe) as the icon for the program, because those
are trademarks owned by Mozilla.</p><p>Normally, Mozilla would have happily given its permission.
After all, having Firefox distributed in Debian is good for Mozilla's
mission of promoting openness on the Web.  However, various technical
and policy effects of the Debian packaging process left Debian unable
to fully comply with Mozilla's trademark usage requirements, and as a
result, Mozilla informed Debian that their Firefox package could not
use the Firefox name or branding.  No doubt Mozilla did so with some
reluctance, as it is not ideal for them to have their software used
without clear attribution.  However, they could have given Debian a
trademark license and yet chose not to; presumably, this is because
Debian was doing something with the code that Mozilla did not want
accruing to their own reputation.<sup>[<a name="idp4086" href="#ftn.idp4086" class="footnote">108</a>]</sup></p><p>This decision by Mozilla did not mean that Debian had to remove
Firefox from their package system, of course.  Debian simply changed
the name to "Iceweasel" and used a different logo.  The underlying
code is still the Mozilla Firefox code, except for the minor bits
Debian had to change to integrate the different name and
logo &#8212; changes they were perfectly free to make, of
course, because of the code's open source license.</p></div><p>It is even consistent to license your project's logo artwork
files under a fully free license while still retaining a trademark on
the logo, as the following story of the GNOME logo and the fish
pedicure shop (I'm not making this up) illustrates.</p><div class="sect2" title="Case study: The GNOME Logo and the Fish Pedicure Shop"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="gnome-fish-pedicure"></a>Case study: The GNOME Logo and the Fish Pedicure Shop</h3></div></div></div><p>The GNOME project (<a class="ulink" href="https://gnome.org/" target="_top">https://gnome.org/</a>), which
produces one of the major free software desktop environments, is
represented legally by the GNOME Foundation (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.gnome.org/foundation/" target="_top">https://www.gnome.org/foundation/</a>),
which owns and enforces trademarks on behalf of the project.  Their
best-known trademark is the GNOME logo: a curved, stylized foot with
four toes floating close above it.<sup>[<a name="idp4096" href="#ftn.idp4096" class="footnote">109</a>]</sup></p><p>One day, Karen Sandler, then the Executive Director of the GNOME
Foundation, heard from a GNOME contributor that a mobile fish-pedicure
van (fish pedicure is a technique in which one places one's feet in
water so that small fish can nibble away dead skin) was using a
modified version of the GNOME logo.  The central foot part of the
image had been slightly modified to look like a fish, and a fifth toe
had been added above, so that the overall logo looked even more like a
human foot but cleverly made reference to fish as well.  You can see
it, along with discussion of other trademark issues GNOME has dealt
with, in the Linux Weekly News article where this story is told in
full: <a class="ulink" href="https://lwn.net/Articles/491639/" target="_top">https://lwn.net/Articles/491639/</a>.</p><p>Although GNOME does actively enforce its trademarks, Sandler did
not see any infringement in this case: the fish-pedicure business is
so distant from what the GNOME Project does that there was no
possibility of confusion in the mind of the public or dilution (if
you'll pardon the expression) of the mark.  Furthermore, because the
<span class="emphasis"><em>copyright</em></span> license on GNOME's images is an open
source license, the fish pedicure company was free to make their
modifications to the graphic and display the results.  There was no
trademark violation, because there was no infringement within GNOME's
domain of activity, and there was no copyright violation, because
GNOME's materials are released under free licenses.</p></div><p>The point of these examples is to merely show that there is no
inherent contradiction in registering and maintaining trademarks
related to open source projects.  This does not mean that a trademark
owner should do whatever they want with the marks, ignoring what other
participants in the project have to say.  Trademarks are like any
other centrally-controlled resource: if you use them in a way that
harms a significant portion of the project's community, then expect
complaints and pushback in return; if you use them in a way that
supports the goals of the project, then most participants will be glad
and will consider that use to be itself a form of contribution.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp4086" href="#idp4086" class="para">108</a>] </sup>In fact, that was
indeed the reason, though we do not need to go into the details here
of exactly what changes Debian makes to the Firefox code that Mozilla
disagrees with strongly enough to want to dissociate their name from
the result.  The entire saga is recounted in more detail at <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation_software_rebranded_by_the_Debian_project" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Corporation_software_rebranded_by_the_Debian_project</a>.
