<em class="firstterm">revision control system</em>) is a combination of
technologies and practices for tracking and controlling changes to a
project's files, in particular to source code, documentation, and web
pages.  If you have never used version control before, the first thing
you should do is go find someone who has, and get them to join your
project.  These days, everyone will expect at least your project's
source code to be under version control, and probably will not take
the project seriously if it doesn't use version control with at least
minimal competence.</p><p>The reason version control is so universal is that it helps with
virtually every aspect of running a project: inter-developer
communications, release management, bug management, code stability and
experimental development efforts, and attribution and authorization of
changes by particular developers.  The version control system provides
a central coordinating force among all of these areas.  The core of
version control is <em class="firstterm">change management</em>:
identifying each discrete change made to the project's files,
annotating each change with metadata like the change's date and
author, and then replaying these facts to whoever asks, in whatever
way they ask.  It is a communications mechanism where a change is the
basic unit of information.</p><p>This section does not discuss all aspects of using a version
control system.  It's so all-encompassing that it must be addressed
topically throughout the book.  Here, we will concentrate on choosing
and setting up a version control system in a way that will foster
cooperative development down the road.</p><div class="sect2" title="Version Control Vocabulary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="vc-vocabulary"/>Version Control Vocabulary</h2></div></div></div><p>This book cannot teach you how to use version control if you've
never used it before, but it would be impossible to discuss the
subject without a few key terms.  These terms are useful independently
of any particular version control system: they are the basic nouns and
verbs of networked collaboration, and will be used generically
throughout the rest of this book.  Even if there were no version
control systems in the world, the problem of change management would
remain, and these words give us a language for talking about that
problem concisely.</p><p>If you're comfortably experienced with version control already,
you can probably skip this section.  If you're not sure, then read
through this section at least once.  Certain version control terms
have gradually changed in meaning since the early 2000s, and you may
occasionally find people using them in incompatible ways in the same
conversation.  Being able to detect that phenomenon early in a
discussion can often be helpful.</p><div class="variablelist"><div class="sidebar" title="&quot;Version&quot; Versus &quot;Revision&quot;"><a id="version-vs-revision"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>"Version" Versus "Revision"</strong></p></div></div></div><p>The word <em class="firstterm">version</em> is sometimes used as a
  synonym for "revision", but I will not use it that way in this
  book, because it is too easily confused with "version" in the sense
  of a version of a piece of software—that is, the release or
  edition number, as in "Version 1.0".  However, since the phrase
  "version control" is already standard, I will continue to use it as
  a synonym for "revision control" and "change control".  Sorry.  One
  of open source's most endearing characteristics is that it has two
  words for everything, and one word for every two things.</p></div><dl><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-commit"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">commit</em></span></dt><dd><p>To make a change to the project; more formally, to
  store a change in the version control database in such a way that it
  can be incorporated into future releases of the project.  "Commit"
  can be used as a verb or a noun.  For example: "I just committed a
  fix for the server crash bug people have been reporting on Mac OS X.
  Jay, could you please review the commit and check that I'm not
  misusing the allocator there?"</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-push"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">push</em></span></dt><dd><p>To publish a commit to a publicly online repository,
  from which others can incorporate it into their copy of the
  project's code.  When one says one has pushed a commit, the
  destination repository is usually implied.  Often it is the
  project's master repository, the one from which public releases are
  made, but not always.</p><p>Note that in some version control systems (e.g., Subversion),
  commits are automatically and unavoidably pushed up to a
  predetermined central repository, while in others (e.g., Git,
  Mercurial) the developer chooses when and where to push commits.
  Because the former types privilege a particular central repository,
  they are known as "centralized" version control systems, while the
  latter are known as "decentralized".  In general, 
  decentralized systems are the modern trend, especially for open
  source projects, which benefit from the peer-to-peer relationship
  between developers' repositories.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-pull"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">pull</em></span></dt><dd><p><span class="emphasis"><em>(or
           "<em class="firstterm">update</em>")</em></span></p><p>To pull others' changes (commits) into your local
  copy of the project.  When pulling changes from a project's mainline
  development branch (see <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#vc-vocabulary-branch"><em class="firstterm">branch</em></a>),
  people often say "update" instead of "pull", for example: "Hey, I
  noticed the indexing code is always dropping the last byte.  Is this
  a new bug?" "Yes, but it was fixed last week—try updating and
  it should go away."</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-commit-message"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">commit message</em> <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> <em class="firstterm">log message</em></span></dt><dd><p>A bit of commentary attached to each commit,

  about equally often; I'll use them interchangeably in this book).
  Log messages are among the most important documents in any project:
  they are the bridge between the detailed, highly technical meaning
  of each individual code changes and the more user-visible world of
  bugfixes, features and project progress.  Later in this section,
  we'll look at ways to distribute them to the appropriate audiences;

  database in which changes are stored and from which they are
  published.  In centralized version control systems, there is a
  single, master repository, which stores all changes to the project,
  and each developer works with a kind of latest summary on her own
  machine.  In decentralized systems, each developer has her own
  repository, changes can be swapped back and forth between
  repositories arbitrarily, and the question of which repository is
  the "master" (that is, the one from which public releases are
  rolled) is defined purely by social convention, instead of by a
  combination of social convention and technical
  enforcement.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-clone"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">clone</em> <span class="emphasis"><em>(see also
  <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#vc-vocabulary-checkout"><em class="firstterm">checkout</em></a>)</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>To obtain one's own development repository by making
  a copy of the project's central repository.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-checkout"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">checkout</em></span></dt><dd><p>When used in discussion, "checkout" usually means
  something like "clone", except that centralized systems don't really
  clone the full repository, they just obtain a <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#vc-vocabulary-working-copy"><em class="firstterm">working copy</em> <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> <em class="firstterm">working files</em></a>.  When
  decentralized systems use the word "checkout", they also mean the
  process of obtaining working files from a repository, but since the
  repository is local in that case, the user experience is quite
  different because the network is not involved.</p><p>In the centralized sense, a checkout produces a directory tree
  called a "working copy" (see below), from which changes may be
  sent back to the original repository.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-working-copy"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">working copy</em> <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> <em class="firstterm">working files</em></span></dt><dd><p>A developer's private directory tree containing the
  project's source code files, and possibly its web pages or other
  documents, in a form that allows the developer to edit them.  A
  working copy also contains some version control metadata saying what
  repository it comes from, what branch it represents, and a few other
  things.  Typically, each developer has her own working copy, from
  which she edits, tests, commits, pulls, pushes,
  etc.</p><p>In decentralized systems, working copies and repositories are
  usually colocated anyway, so the term "working copy" is less often
  used.  Developers instead tend to say "my clone" or "my copy" or
  sometimes "my fork".</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-revision"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">revision</em>,

        or (again) <span class="emphasis"><em>commit</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>A "revision" is a precisely specified incarnation of
  the project at a point in time, or of a particular file or directory
  in the project.  These days, most systems also use "revision",
  "change", "changeset", or "commit" to refer to a set of changes
  committed together as one conceptual unit, if multiple files were
  involved, though colloquially most people would refer to changeset
  12's effect on file F as "revision 12 of F".</p><p>These terms occasionally have distinct technical meanings in
  different version control systems, but the general idea is always
  the same: they give a way to speak precisely about exact points in
  time in the history of a file or a set of files (say, immediately
  before and after a bug is fixed).  For example: "Oh yes, she fixed
  that in revision 10" or "She fixed that in commit fa458b1fac".</p><p>When one talks about a file or collection of files without
  specifying a particular revision, it is generally assumed that one
  means the most recent revision(s) available.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-diff"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">diff</em></span></dt><dd><p>A textual representation of a change.  A diff shows
  which lines were changed and how, plus a few lines of surrounding
  context on either side.  A developer who is already familiar with
  some code can usually read a diff against that code and understand
  what the change did, and often even spot bugs.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-tag"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">tag</em> <span class="emphasis"><em>or</em></span> <em class="firstterm">snapshot</em></span></dt><dd><p>A label for a particular state of the project at a
  point in time.  Tags are generally used to mark interesting
  snapshots of the project.  For example, a tag is usually made for
  each public release, so that one can obtain, directly from the
  version control system, the exact set of files/revisions comprising
  that release.  Tag names are often things like
  <code class="literal">Release_1_0</code>, <code class="literal">Delivery_20130630</code>,
  etc.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-branch"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">branch</em></span></dt><dd><p>A copy of the project, under version control but
  isolated so that changes made to the branch don't affect other
  branches of the project, and vice versa, except when changes are
  deliberately "merged" from one branch to another (see below).
  Branches are also known as "lines of development".  Even when a
  project has no explicit branches, development is still considered
  to be happening on the "main branch", also known as the "main line"
  or "<em class="firstterm">trunk</em>" or
  "<em class="firstterm">master</em>".</p><p>Branches offer a way to keep different lines of development
  from interfering with each other.  For example, a branch can be used
  for experimental development that would be too destabilizing for the
  main trunk.  Or conversely, a branch can be used as a place to
  stabilize a new release.  During the release process, regular
  development would continue uninterrupted in the main branch of the
  repository; meanwhile, on the release branch, no changes are allowed
  except those approved by the release managers.  This way, making a
  release needn't interfere with ongoing development work.  See <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#branches" title="Use branches to avoid bottlenecks">

  includes merging from the main trunk to some other branch, or vice
  versa.  In fact, those are the most common kinds of merges; it is
  less common to port a change between two non-trunk branches.  See

      بخشی بنام
      “Singularity of information”
    </a> for more on change porting.</p><p>"Merge" has a second, related meaning: it is what some version
  control systems do when they see that two people have changed the
  same file but in non-overlapping ways.  Since the two changes do not
  interfere with each other, when one of the people updates their copy
  of the file (already containing their own changes), the other
  person's changes will be automatically merged in.  This is very
  common, especially on projects where multiple people are hacking on
  the same code.  When two different changes <span class="emphasis"><em>do</em></span>
  overlap, the result is a "conflict"; see below.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-conflict"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">conflict</em></span></dt><dd><p>What happens when two people try to make different
  changes to the same place in the code.  All version control systems
  automatically detect conflicts, and notify at least one of the
  humans involved that their changes conflict with someone else's.  It
  is then up to that human to <em class="firstterm">resolve</em> the
  conflict, and to communicate that resolution to the version control
  system.</p></dd><dt><a id="vc-vocabulary-lock"/><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">lock</em></span></dt><dd><p>A way to declare an exclusive intent to change a
  particular file or directory.  For example, "I can't commit any
  changes to the web pages right now.  It seems Alfred has them all
  locked while he fixes their background images."  Not all version
  control systems even offer the ability to lock, and of those that
  do, not all require the locking feature to be used.  This is because
  parallel, simultaneous development is the norm, and locking people
  out of files is (usually) contrary to this ideal.</p><p>Version control systems that require locking to make commits
  are said to use the <em class="firstterm">lock-modify-unlock</em> model.
  Those that do not are said to use the
  <em class="firstterm">copy-modify-merge</em> model.  An excellent
  in-depth explanation and comparison of the two models may be found
  at <a class="ulink" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.basic.version-control-basics.html#svn.basic.vsn-models">svnbook.red-bean.com/nightly/en/svn.basic.version-control-basics.html#svn.basic.vsn-models</a>.  In
  general, the copy-modify-merge model is better for open source
  development, and all the version control systems discussed in this
  book support that model.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Choosing a Version Control System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="vc-choosing"/>Choosing a Version Control System</h2></div></div></div><p>If you don't already have a strong opinion about which version
control system your project should use, then choose Git (<a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>), and host your
project's repositories at <a class="ulink" href="http://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>, which offers unlimited free hosting for open
source projects.</p><p>Git is by now the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">de facto</em></span>
standard in the open source world, as is hosting one's repositories at
GitHub.  Because so many developers are already comfortable with that
combination, choosing it sends the signal that your project is ready
for participants.  But Git-at-GitHub is not the only viable
combination.  Two other reasonable choices of version control system
are <a class="ulink" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> and
<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/">Subversion</a>.
Mercurial and Git are both decentralized systems, whereas Subversion
is centralized.  All three are offered at many different free hosting
services; some services even support more than one of them (though
GitHub only supports Git, as its name suggests).  While some projects
host their repositories on their own servers, most just put their
repositories on one of the free hosting services, as described in
<a class="xref" href="">???</a>.</p><p>There isn't space here for an in-depth exploration of why you
might choose something other than Git.  If you have a reason to do so,
then you already know what that reason is.  If you don't, then just
use Git (and probably on GitHub).  If you find yourself using
something other than Git, Mercurial, or Subversion, ask yourself
why — because whatever that other version control
system is, most other developers won't be familiar with it, and it
likely has a smaller and less stable community of support around it
than the big three do.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Using the Version Control System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="vc-using"/>Using the Version Control System</h2></div></div></div><p>The recommendations in this section are not targeted toward a
particular version control system, and should be implementable in any
of them.  Consult your specific system's documentation for
details.</p><div class="sect3" title="Version everything"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="version-everything"/>Version everything</h3></div></div></div><p>Keep not only your project's source code under version control,
but also its web pages, documentation, FAQ, design notes, and anything
else that people might want to edit.  Keep them right with the
source code, in the same repository tree.  Any piece of information
worth writing down is worth versioning—that is, any piece of
information that could change.  Things that don't change should be
archived, not versioned.  For example, an email, once posted, does not
change; therefore, versioning it wouldn't make sense (unless it becomes
part of some larger, evolving document).</p><p>The reason to version everything together in one place is so
that people only have to learn one mechanism for submitting changes.
Often a contributor will start out making edits to the web pages or
documentation, and move to small code contributions later, for
example.  When the project uses the same system for all kinds of
submissions, people only have to learn the ropes once.  Versioning
everything together also means that new features can be committed
together with their documentation updates, that branching the code
will branch the documentation too, etc.</p><p>Don't keep <em class="firstterm">generated files</em> under version
control.  They are not truly editable data, since they are produced
programmatically from other files.  For example, some build systems
create a file named <code class="filename">configure</code> based on a template
in <code class="filename">configure.in</code>.  To make a change to the
<code class="filename">configure</code>, one would edit
<code class="filename">configure.in</code> and then regenerate; thus, only the
template <code class="filename">configure.in</code> is an "editable file."
Just version the templates—if you version the generated files as
well, people will inevitably forget to regenerate them when they commit a
change to a template, and the resulting inconsistencies will cause no
end of confusion.</p><p>There are technical exceptions to the rule that all editable
data should be kept in the same version control system as the code.
For example, a project's bug tracker and its wiki hold plenty of
editable data, but usually do not store that data in the main version
control system<sup>[<a id="idp6051760" href="#ftn.idp6051760" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup>.  However,
they should still have versioning systems of their own, e.g., the
comment history in a bug ticket, and the ability to browse past
revisions and view differences between them in a wiki.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Browsability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="vc-browsing"/>Browsability</h3></div></div></div><p>The project's repository should be browsable on the Web.  This
means not only the ability to see the latest revisions of the
project's files, but to go back in time and look at earlier revisions,
view the differences between revisions, read log messages for selected
changes, etc.</p><p>Browsability is important because it is a lightweight portal to
project data.  If the repository cannot be viewed through a web
browser, then someone wanting to inspect a particular file (say, to
see if a certain bugfix had made it into the code) would first have to
install version control client software locally, which could turn
their simple query from a two-minute task into a half-hour or longer
task.</p><p>Browsability also implies canonical URLs for viewing a particular
change (i.e., a commit), and for viewing the latest revision at any given
time without specifying its commit identifier.  This can be very
useful in technical discussions or when
pointing people to documentation.  For example, instead of saying "For
bug management guidelines, see the community-guide/index.html file
in your working copy," one can say "For bug management guidelines,
see
<span class="emphasis"><em>http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</em></span>,"
giving a URL that always points to the latest revision of the
<code class="filename">community-guides/index.html</code> file.  The URL is
better because it is completely unambiguous, and avoids the question
of whether the addressee has an up-to-date working copy.</p><p>Some version control systems come with built-in
repository-browsing mechanisms, and in any case most hosting sites
offer a good web interface.  But if you need to install a third-party
tool for repository browsing, there are many out there.  Three that
support Git are <em class="firstterm">GitLab</em> (<a class="ulink" href="http://gitlab.org/">gitlab.org</a>),
<em class="firstterm">GitWeb</em> (<a class="ulink" href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb">git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Gitweb</a>), and
<em class="firstterm">GitList</em> (<a class="ulink" href="http://gitlist.org/">gitlist.org</a>).  For Subversion, there is
<em class="firstterm">ViewVC</em> (<a class="ulink" href="http://viewvc.org/">viewvc.org</a>).  A web search will turn up plenty of others
besides these.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Use branches to avoid bottlenecks"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="branches"/>Use branches to avoid bottlenecks</h3></div></div></div><p>Non-expert version control users are sometimes a bit afraid of
branching and merging.  If you are among those people, resolve right
now to conquer any fears you may have and take the time to learn how
to do branching and merging.  They are not difficult operations, once
you get used to them, and they become increasingly important as a
project acquires more developers.</p><p>Branches are valuable because they turn a scarce
resource—working room in the project's code—into an
abundant one.  Normally, all developers work together in the same
sandbox, constructing the same castle.  When someone wants to add a
new drawbridge, but can't convince everyone else that it would be an
improvement, branching makes it possible for her to make a copy of the
castle, take it off to an isolated corner, and try out the new
drawbridge design.  If the effort succeeds, she can invite the
other developers to examine the result (in GitHub-speak, this
invitation is known as a "pull request" — see <a class="xref" href="ch03s04.html#pull-requests" title="Pull requests">
      بخشی بنام
      “Pull requests”
    </a>).  If everyone agrees that the
result is good, she or someone else can tell the version control
system to move ("merge") the drawbridge from the branch version of the
castle over to the main version, sometimes called the
<em class="firstterm">master branch</em>.</p><p>It's easy to see how this ability helps collaborative
development.  People need the freedom to try new things without
feeling like they're interfering with others' work.  Equally
importantly, there are times when code needs to be isolated from the
usual development churn, in order to get a bug fixed or a release
stabilized (see <a class="xref" href="ch07s03.html" title="Stabilizing a Release">
      بخشی بنام
      “Stabilizing a Release”
    </a> and
<a class="xref" href="ch07s06.html" title="Maintaining Multiple Release Lines">
      بخشی بنام
      “Maintaining Multiple Release Lines”
    </a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="فصل 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">
      فصل 7, <em>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</em></a></span>) without worrying
about tracking a moving target.  At the same time, people need to be
able to review and comment on experimental work, whether it's
happening in the master branch or somewhere else.  Treating branches
as first-class, publishable objects makes all this possible.</p><p>Use branches liberally, and encourage others to use them.  But
also make sure that a given branch is only active for as long as
needed.  Every active branch is a slight drain on the community's
attention.  Even those who are not working in a branch still maintain
a peripheral awareness of what's going on in it.  Such awareness is
desirable, of course, and commit notices should be sent out for branch
commits just as for any other commit.  But branches should not become
a mechanism for dividing the development community.  With rare
exceptions, the eventual goal of most branches should be to merge
their changes back into the main line and disappear.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Singularity of information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="vc-singularity"/>Singularity of information</h3></div></div></div><p>Merging has an important corollary: never commit the same change
twice.  That is, a given change should enter the version control
system exactly once.  The revision (or set of revisions) in which the
change entered is its unique identifier from then on.  If it needs to
be applied to branches other than the one on which it entered, then it
should be merged from its original entry point to those other
destinations—as opposed to committing a textually identical
change, which would have the same effect in the code, but would make
accurate bookkeeping and release management much harder.</p><p>The practical effects of this advice differ from one version
control system to another.  In some systems, merges are special
events, fundamentally distinct from commits, and carry their own
metadata with them.  In others, the results of merges are committed
the same way other changes are committed, so the primary means of
distinguishing a "merge commit" from a "new change commit" is in the
log message.  In a merge's log message, don't repeat the log message
of the original change.  Instead, just indicate that this is a merge,
and give the identifying revision of the original change, with at most
a one-sentence summary of its effect.  If someone wants to see the
full log message, she should consult the original revision.</p><p>One reason it's important to avoid repeating the log message is
that, in some systems, log messages are sometimes edited after they've
been committed.  If a change's log message were repeated at each merge
destination, then even if someone edited the original message, she'd
still leave all the repeats uncorrected—which would only cause
confusion down the road.  Another reason is that non-duplication makes
it easier to be sure when one has tracked down the original source of
a change.  When you're looking at a complete log message that doesn't
refer to a some other merge source, you can know that it must be the
original change, and handle it accordingly.</p><p>The same principle applies to reverting a change.  If a change
is withdrawn from the code, then the log message for the reversion
should merely state that some specific revision(s) is being reverted,
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> describe the actual code change that results
from the reversion, since the semantics of the change can be derived
by reading the original log message and change.  Of course, the
reversion's log message should also state the reason why the change is
being reverted, but it should not duplicate anything from the original
change's log message.  If possible, go back and edit the original
change's log message to point out that it was reverted.</p><p>All of the above implies that you should use a consistent syntax
for referring to changes.  This is helpful not only in log messages,
but in emails, the bug tracker, and elsewhere.  In Git and Mercurial,
the syntax is usually "commit bb2377" (where the commit hash code on
the right is long enough to be unique in the relevant context); in
Subversion, revision numbers are linearly incremented integers and the
standard syntax for, say, revision 1729 is "r1729".  In other systems,
there is usually a standard syntax for expressing the changeset name.
Whatever the appropriate syntax is for your system, encourage people
to use it when referring to changes.  Consistent expression of change
names makes project bookkeeping much easier (as we will see in <a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="فصل 6. Communications">
      فصل 6, <em>Communications</em></a> and <a class="xref" href="ch07.html" title="فصل 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">
      فصل 7, <em>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</em></a>),
and since a lot of the bookkeeping may be done by volunteers, it
needs to be as easy as possible.</p><p>See also

people can be allowed or disallowed from committing in specific
sub-areas of the master repository.  Following the principle that when
handed a hammer, people start looking around for nails, many projects use
this feature with abandon, carefully granting people access to just
those areas where they have been approved to commit, and making sure
they can't commit anywhere else.  (See
<a class="xref" href="ch08s04.html" title="Committers">
      بخشی بنام
      “Committers”
    </a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch08.html" title="فصل 8. Managing Volunteers">
      فصل 8, <em>Managing Volunteers</em></a></span> for how projects
decide who can put changes where.)</p><p>Exercising such tight control is usually unnecessary, and may
even be harmful.  Some projects simply use an honor system: when a
person is granted commit access, even for a sub-area of the project,
what they actually receive is the ability to commit anywhere in the
master repository.  They're just asked to keep their commits in their
area.  Remember that there is little real risk here: the repository
provides an audit trail, and in an active project, all commits are
reviewed anyway.  If someone commits where they're not supposed to,
others will notice it and say something.  If a change needs to be
undone, that's simple enough—everything's under version control
anyway, so just revert.</p><p>There are several advantages to this more relaxed approach.
First, as developers expand into other areas (which they usually will
if they stay with the project), there is no administrative overhead to
granting them wider privileges.  Once the decision is made, the person
can just start committing in the new area right away.</p><p>Second, expansion can be done in a more fine-grained manner.
Generally, a committer in area X who wants to expand to area Y will
start posting patches against Y and asking for review.  If someone who
already has commit access to area Y sees such a patch and approves of
it, she can just tell the submitter to commit the change directly
(mentioning the reviewer/approver's name in the log message, of
course).  That way, the commit will come from the person who actually
wrote the change, which is preferable from both an information
management standpoint and from a crediting standpoint.</p><p>Last, and perhaps most important, using the honor system
encourages an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect.  Giving someone
commit access to a subdomain is a statement about their technical
preparedness—it says: "We see you have expertise to make commits
in a certain domain, so go for it."  But imposing strict authorization
controls says: "Not only are we asserting a limit on your expertise,
we're also a bit suspicious about
your <span class="emphasis"><em>intentions</em></span>."  That's not the sort of
statement you want to make if you can avoid it.  Bringing someone into
the project as a committer is an opportunity to initiate them into a
circle of mutual trust.  A good way to do that is to give them more
power than they're supposed to use, then inform them that it's up to
them to stay within the stated limits.</p><p>The Subversion project has operated on this honor system way or
well over a decade, with more than 40 full committers and many more
partial committers as of this writing.  The only distinction the
system actually enforces is
between committers and non-committers; further subdivisions are
maintained solely by human judgement.  Yet the project never had a
serious problem with someone deliberately committing outside their
domain.  Once or twice there's been an innocent misunderstanding about
the extent of someone's commit privileges, but it's always been
resolved quickly and amiably.</p><p>Obviously, in situations where self-policing is impractical, you
must rely on hard authorization controls.  But such situations are
rare.  Even when there are millions of lines of code and hundreds or
thousands of developers, a commit to any given code module should
still be reviewed by those who work on that module, and they can
recognize if someone committed there who wasn't supposed to.  If
regular commit review <span class="emphasis"><em>isn't</em></span> happening, then the
project has bigger problems to deal with than the authorization system
anyway.</p><p>In summary, don't spend too much time fiddling with the version
control authorization system, unless you have a specific reason to.  It
usually won't bring much tangible benefit, and there are advantages to
relying on human controls instead.</p><p>None of this should be taken to mean that the restrictions
themselves are unimportant, of course.  It would be bad for a project
to encourage people to commit in areas where they're not qualified.
Furthermore, in many projects, full (unrestricted) commit access has a
special corollary status: it implies voting rights on project-wide
questions.  This political aspect of commit access is discussed more

who made the change, when they made it, what files and directories
changed, and how they changed.  The email should go to a special
mailing list devoted to commit emails, separate from the mailing lists
to which humans post.  Developers and other interested parties should
be encouraged to subscribe to the commits list, as it is the most
effective way to keep up with what's happening in the project at the
code level.  Aside from the obvious technical benefits of peer review
(see <a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">
      بخشی بنام
      “Practice Conspicuous Code Review”
    </a>), commit emails help create a
sense of community, because they establish a shared environment in
which people can react to events (commits) that they know are visible
to others as well.</p><p>The specifics of setting up commit emails will vary depending on
your version control system, but usually there's a script or other
packaged facility for doing it.  If you're having trouble finding it,
try looking for documentation on <em class="firstterm">hooks</em> (or
sometimes <em class="firstterm">triggers</em>) specifically a
<em class="firstterm">post-commit hook</em> hook.  Post-commit hooks are a
general means of launching automated tasks in response to commits.
The hook is triggered when a given commit finalizes, is fed all the
information about that commit, and is then free to use that
information to do anything—for example, to send out an
email.</p><p>With pre-packaged commit email systems, you may want to
modify some of the default behaviors:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Some commit mailers don't include the actual diffs in the
  email, but instead provide a URL to view the change on the web using
  the repository browsing system.  While it's good to provide the URL,
  so the change can be referred to later, it is also important that
  the commit email include
  the diffs themselves.  Reading email is already part of people's
  routine, so if the content of the change is visible right there in
  the commit email, developers will review the commit on the spot,
  without leaving their mail reader.  If they have to click on a URL to
  review the change, most won't do it, because that requires a new
  action instead of a continuation of what they were already doing.
  Furthermore, if the reviewer wants to ask something about the
  change, it's vastly easier to hit reply-with-text and simply
  annotate the quoted diff than it is to visit a web page and
  laboriously cut-and-paste parts of the diff from web browser to
  email client.</p><p>(Of course, if the diff is huge, such as when a large body of
  new code has been added to the repository, then it makes sense to
  omit the diff and offer only the URL.  Most commit mailers can do
  this kind of size-limiting automatically.  If yours can't, then it's
  still better to include diffs, and live with the occasional huge
  email, than to leave the diffs off entirely.  Convenient reviewing
  and commenting is a cornerstone of cooperative development, and much
  too important to do without.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The commit emails should set their Reply-to header
  to the regular development list, not the commit email list.  That
  is, when someone reviews a commit and writes a response, their
  response should be automatically directed toward the human
  development list, where technical issues are normally discussed.
  There are a few reasons for this.  First, you want to keep all
  technical discussion on one list, because that's where people expect
  it to happen, and because that way there's only one archive to
  search.  Second, there might be interested parties not subscribed to
  the commit email list.  Third, the commit email list advertises
  itself as a service for watching commits, not for watching commits
  <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> having occasional technical discussions.
  Those who subscribed to the commit email list did not sign up for
  anything but commit emails; sending them other material via that
  list would violate an implicit contract.</p><p>Note that this advice to set Reply-to does not contradict the
  recommendations in

  always okay for the <span class="emphasis"><em>sender</em></span> of a message to set
  Reply-to.  In this case, the sender is the version control system

  appropriate place for replies is the development mailing list, not
