what it sounds like: final decision-making authority rests with one
person, who, by virtue of personality and experience, is expected
to use it wisely.</p><p>Although "benevolent dictator" (or <em class="firstterm">BD</em>) is
the standard term for this role, it would be better to think of it as
"community-approved arbitrator" or "judge".  Generally, benevolent
dictators do not actually make all the decisions, or even most of the
decisions.  It's unlikely that one person could have enough expertise
to make consistently good decisions across all areas of the project,
and anyway, quality developers won't stay around unless they have some
influence on the project's direction.  Therefore, benevolent dictators
commonly do not dictate much.  Instead, they let things work
themselves out through discussion and experimentation whenever
possible.  They participate in those discussions themselves, but as
regular developers, often deferring to an area maintainer who has more
expertise.  Only when it is clear that no consensus can be reached,
and that most of the group <span class="emphasis"><em>wants</em></span> someone to guide
the decision so that development can move on, does she put her foot
down and say "This is the way it's going to be."  Reluctance to make
decisions by fiat is a trait shared by almost all successful
benevolent dictators; it is one of the reasons they manage to keep the
role.</p><div class="sect2" title="Who Can Be a Good Benevolent Dictator?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="benevolent-dictator-qualifications"/>Who Can Be a Good Benevolent Dictator?</h2></div></div></div><a id="benevolant-dictator-qualifications"/><p>Being a BD requires a combination of traits.  It needs, first of
all, a well-honed sensitivity to one's own influence in the project,
which in turn brings self-restraint.  In the early stages of a
discussion, one should not express opinions and conclusions with so
much certainty that others feel like it's pointless to dissent.
People must be free to air ideas, even stupid ideas.  It is inevitable
that the BD will post a stupid idea from time to time too, of course,
and therefore the role also requires an ability to recognize and
acknowledge when one has made a bad decision — though this is
simply a trait that <span class="emphasis"><em>any</em></span> good developer should
have, especially if she stays with the project a long time.  But the
difference is that the BD can afford to slip from time to time without
worrying about long-term damage to her credibility.  Developers with
less seniority may not feel so secure, so the BD should phrase
critiques or contrary decisions with some sensitivity for how much
weight her words carry, both technically and psychologically.</p><p>The BD does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> need to have the sharpest
technical skills of anyone in the project.  She must be skilled enough
to work on the code herself, and to understand and comment on any
change under consideration, but that's all.  The BD position is
neither acquired nor held by virtue of intimidating coding skills.
What <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important is experience and overall
design sense — not necessarily the ability to produce good
design on demand, but the ability to recognize and endorse good
design, whatever its source.</p><p>It is common for the benevolent dictator to be a founder of the
project, but this is more a correlation than a cause.  The sorts of
qualities that make one able to successfully start a
project — technical competence, ability to persuade other people
to join, and so on — are exactly the qualities any BD would need.  And
of course, founders start out with a sort of automatic seniority,
which can often be enough to make benevolent dictatorship by the
founder appear the path of least resistance for all concerned.</p><p>Remember that the potential to fork goes both ways.  A BD can
fork a project just as easily as anyone else, and some have
occasionally done so, when they felt that the direction they wanted to
take the project was different from where the majority of other
developers wanted to go.  Because of forkability, it does not matter
whether the benevolent dictator has control over the currently
accepted "master" project repository.  People sometimes talk of repository
control as though it were the ultimate source of power in a project,
but in fact it is irrelevant.  The ability to add or remove people's
commit passwords for one project on a particular hosting site affects
only that copy of the project on that site.  Prolonged abuse of that
power, whether by the BD or someone else, would simply lead to
development moving to a different copy of the project.</p></div><p>Whether your project should have a benevolent dictator, or would
run better with some less centralized form of governance, largely
depends on who is available to fill the role.  As a general rule, if
it's simply obvious to everyone who should be the BD, then that's the
way to go.  But if no candidate for BD is immediately obvious, then
the project should probably use a decentralized decision-making
process, as described in the next section.</p></div></body></html>
