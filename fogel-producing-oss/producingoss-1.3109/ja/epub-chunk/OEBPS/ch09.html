open source software, and participating in existing open source
projects; I'll also look at government usage of open source software,
to the extent that it overlaps with those main topics.</p><p>Since the first edition of this book in 2005, I've worked with
various U.S. government agencies — at the federal,
state, and municipal levels — helping them release
open source software.  I've also been lucky enough to observe, and in
a few cases work with, some government agencies outside the U.S.
These experiences have convinced me of one thing: government is
different.  If you work at a government agency and the material in
this book so far has made you shake your head and think "Sure, but
it'll never work here", you don't have to convince
me — I already know what you mean.  Governments differ
from individuals and from private-sector organizations in some
fundamental ways:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Governments often aren't trying to retain technical
  expertise in-house (that's what contractors are for).</li><li class="listitem">Governments have labyrinthine and in certain ways
  inflexible procurement and employment policies.  These policies can
  make it difficult for a government agency to be nimbly responsive in
  an open source development community.</li><li class="listitem">Government agencies tend to be unusually risk-averse.
  Somewhere at the top there's an elected official who, reasonably,
  sees an open source project as just one more surface area for
  opponents to attack.  After all, when development happens in public,
  the inevitable false starts and wrong turns are also public; if
  development were internal, no one else would know about it when
  those things happen.</li><li class="listitem">Government officials hunger for well-timed and
  well-controlled publicity events.  This has certain benefits, but it
  can sometimes come at the expense of overall project health.
  This need for publicity is the complement of being risk-averse:
  elected officials and those who work for them understand that most
  people aren't paying much attention most of the
  time — therefore, those who work in government want
  to ensure that in the few moments when people
  <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> paying attention, they see something
  good.  This is understandable, but it can cause them to delay
  certain actions — or, in some cases, do them too
  soon — based on external publicity implications
  rather than on what's best for the project technically and
  socially.</li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>There are good reasons for all of these things; they've been
true for decades if not centuries, and they're not going to change.
So if you're a government agency and you want to start a successful
open source project, certain adjustments will be necessary to
compensate for the structural idiosyncracies above.  The advice that
follows is most applicable to the U.S. and countries with similar
systems of government and civil service.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Be Open Source From Day One, Not Day N"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="be-open-from-day-one"/>Be Open Source From Day One, Not Day N</h1></div></div></div><p>(poss2: recast blog post of the same name)</p></div></div></body></html>
