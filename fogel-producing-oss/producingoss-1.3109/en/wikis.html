developers.  Wikis offer the lowest possible barrier-to-entry for
those seeking to contribute to the project.  You just click and
edit &#8212; the wiki software will keep track of the
change, make sure you get credited, notify anyone who needs to be
notified, and immediately publish the new content to the world.</p><p>However, wikis also require some centralized effort to maintain.
When open source software project wikis go bad, they usually go bad
for the same reasons: lack of consistent organization and editing,
leading to a mess of outdated and redundant pages, and lack of clarity
on who the target audience is for a given page or section.</p><p>From the outset, try to have a clear page organization strategy
and even a pleasing visual layout, so that visitors (i.e., potential
editors) will instinctively know how to fit their contributions in.
Make sure the intended audience is clear at all times to all editors.
Most importantly, document these standards in the wiki itself and
point people to them, so editors have somewhere to go for guidance.
Too often, wiki administrators fall victim to the fantasy that because
hordes of visitors are individually adding high quality content to the
site, the sum of all these contributions must therefore also be of
high quality.  That's not how collaborative editing works.  Each
individual page or paragraph may be good when considered by itself,
but it will not be good if embedded in a disorganized or confusing
whole.</p><p>In general, wikis will amplify any failings that are present
from early on, since contributors tend to imitate whatever patterns
they see in front of them.  So don't just set up the wiki and hope
everything falls into place.  You must also prime it with well-written
content, so people have a template to follow.</p><p>The shining example of a well-run wiki is Wikipedia, of course,
but in many ways it's also a poor example because it gets so much more
editorial attention than any other wiki in the world.  Still, if you
examine Wikipedia closely, you'll see that its administrators laid a
<span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> thorough foundation for cooperation.  There
is extensive documentation on how to write new entries, how to
maintain an appropriate point of view, what sorts of edits to make,
what edits to avoid, a dispute resolution process for contested edits
(involving several stages, including eventual arbitration), and so
forth.  They also have authorization controls, so that if a page is
the target of repeated inappropriate edits, they can lock it down
until the problem is resolved.  In other words, they didn't just throw
some templates onto a web site and hope for the best.  Wikipedia works
because its editors give careful thought to getting thousands of
strangers to tailor their writing to a common vision.  While you may
not need the same level of preparedness to run a wiki for a free
software project, the spirit is worth emulating.</p><div class="sect2" title="Wikis and Spam"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="wiki-spam"></a>Wikis and Spam</h3></div></div></div><p>Never allow open, anonymous editing on your wiki.  The days when
that was possible are <span class="emphasis"><em>long</em></span> gone now; today, any
open wiki other than Wikipedia will be covered completely with spam in
approximately 3 milliseconds.  (Wikipedia is an exception because it
has an exceptionally large number of readers willing to clean up spam
quickly, and because it has a well-funded organization behind it
devoted to resisting spam using various large-scale monitoring
techniques not practically available to smaller projects.)</p><p>All edits in your project's wiki must come from registered
users; if your wiki software doesn't already enforce this by default,
then configure it to enforce that.  Even then you may need to keep
watch for spam edits from users who registered under false pretenses
for the purpose of spamming.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Choosing a Wiki"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="wiki-choosing"></a>Choosing a Wiki</h3></div></div></div><p>If your project is on GitHub or some other free hosting site,
it's usually best to use the built-in wiki feature that most such
sites offer.  That way your wiki will be automatically integrated with
your repository or other project permissions, and you can rely on the
site's user account system instead of having a separate registration
system for the wiki.</p><p>If you are setting up your own wiki, then you're free to choose
which one, and fortunately there are plenty of good free software wiki
implementations available.  I've had good experience with DokuWiki
(<a class="ulink" href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki" target="_top">https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki</a>), but there are many others.  There is
a wonderful tool called the Wiki Choice Wizard at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.wikimatrix.org/" target="_top">http://www.wikimatrix.org/</a> that allows
you to specify the features you care about (an open source license can
be one of them) and then view a chart comparing all the wiki software
that meets those criteria.  Another good resource is Wikipedia's own
page comparing different wikis: <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_wiki_software</a>.</p><p>I do not recommend using MediaWiki (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.mediawiki.org" target="_top">https://www.mediawiki.org</a>) as the wiki
software for most projects.  MediaWiki is the software on which
Wikipedia itself runs, and while it is very good at that, its
administrative facilities are tuned to the needs of a site unlike any
other wiki on the Net &#8212; and actually not so well-tuned
to the needs of smaller editing communities.  Many projects are
tempted to choose MediaWiki because they think it will be easier for
users who already know its editing syntax from having edited at
Wikipedia, but this turns out to be an almost non-existent advantage
for several reasons.  First, wikis in general, including Wikipedia,
are tending toward rich-text in-browser editing anyway, so that no one
really needs to learn the underlying wiki syntax unless they aim to be
a power user.  Second, many other wikis offer a MediaWiki-syntax
plugin, so you can have that syntax anyway if you really want it.
Third, for those who will use a plaintext syntax instead of rich-text
editing, it's better to use a standardized generic markup format like
Markdown (<a class="ulink" href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_top">https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/</a>), which is available in
many wikis either natively or via a plugin, than to use a wiki syntax
of any flavor.  If you support Markdown, then people can edit in your
wiki using the same markup syntax they already know from GitHub and
other popular tools.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="irc.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="technical-infrastructure.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="q-and-a-forums.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">IRC / Real-Time Chat Systems </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Q&amp;A Forums</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
