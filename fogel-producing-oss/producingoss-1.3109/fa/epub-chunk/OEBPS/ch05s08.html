source project.  From the point of view of the project's volunteers,
it's the most visible and glamorous part.  This unfortunately means
that other activities, such as documentation, formal testing, etc., can
sometimes be neglected, at least compared to the amount of attention
they often receive in proprietary software.  Corporate organizations
are sometimes able to make up for this, by devoting some of their
internal software development infrastructure to open source
projects.</p><p>The key to doing this successfully is to translate between the
company's internal processes and those of the public development
community.  Such translation is not effortless: often the two are not
a close match, and the differences can only be bridged via human
intervention.  For example, the company may use a different bug
tracker than the public project.  Even if they use the same tracking
software, the data stored in it will be very different, because the
bug-tracking needs of a company are very different from those of a
free software community.  A piece of information that starts in one
tracker may need to be reflected in the other, with confidential
portions removed or, in the other direction, added.</p><p>The sections that follow are about how to build and maintain
such bridges.  The end result should be that the open source project
runs more smoothly, the community recognizes the company's investment
of resources, and yet does not feel that the company is
inappropriately steering things toward its own goals.</p><div class="sect2" title="Quality Assurance (i.e., Professional Testing)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="fund-qa"/>Quality Assurance (i.e., Professional Testing)</h2></div></div></div><a id="subsidize-qa"/><p>In proprietary software development, it is normal to have teams
of people dedicated solely to quality assurance: bug hunting,
performance and scalability testing, interface and documentation
checking, etc.  As a rule, these activities are not pursued as
vigorously by the volunteer community on a free software project.
This is partly because it's hard to get volunteer labor for
unglamorous work like testing, partly because people tend to assume
that having a large user community gives the project good testing
coverage, and, in the case of performance and scalability testing,
partly because volunteers often don't have access to the necessary
hardware resources anyway.</p><p>The assumption that having many users is equivalent to having
many testers is not entirely baseless.  Certainly there's little point
assigning testers for basic functionality in common environments: bugs
there will quickly be found by users in the natural course of things.
But because users are just trying to get work done, they do not
consciously set out to explore uncharted edge cases in the program's
functionality, and are likely to leave certain classes of bugs
unfound.  Furthermore, when they discover a bug with an easy
workaround, they often silently implement the workaround without
bothering to report the bug.  Most insidiously, the usage patterns of
your customers (the people who drive <span class="emphasis"><em>your</em></span>
interest in the software) may differ in statistically significant ways
from the usage patterns of the Average User In The Street.</p><p>A professional testing team can uncover these sorts of bugs, and
can do so as easily with free software as with proprietary software.
The challenge is to convey the testing team's results back to the
public in a useful form.  In-house testing departments usually have
their own way of reporting test results to their own developers,
involving company-specific
jargon, or specialized knowledge about particular customers and their
data sets.  Such reports would be inappropriate for the public bug
tracker, both because of their form and because of confidentiality
concerns.  Even if your company's internal bug tracking software
were the same as that used by the public project, management might
need to make company-specific comments and metadata changes to the
tickets (for example, to raise an ticket's internal priority, or
schedule its resolution for a particular customer).  Usually such
notes are confidential—sometimes they're not even shown to the
customer.  But even when they're not confidential, they're not very
helpful to the public project.</p><p>Yet the core bug report itself <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> important
to the public.  In fact, a bug report from your testing department is
in some ways more valuable than one received from users at large,
since the testing department probes for things that other users won't.
Given that you're unlikely to get that particular bug report from any
other source, you definitely want to preserve it and make it
available to the public project.</p><p>To do this, either the QA department can file tickets directly in
the public ticket tracker, if they're comfortable with that, or an
intermediary (usually one of the developers) can "translate" the
testing department's internal reports into new tickets in the public
tracker.  Translation simply means describing the bug in a way that
makes no reference to customer-specific information (the reproduction
recipe may use customer data, assuming the customer approves it, of
course).</p><p>It is definitely preferable to have the QA department filing
tickets in the public tracker directly.  That gives the public a more
direct appreciation of your company's involvement with the project:
useful bug reports add to your organization's credibility just as any
technical contribution would.  It also gives developers a direct line
of communication to the testing team.  For example, if the internal QA
team is monitoring the public ticket tracker, a developer can commit a
fix for a scalability bug (which the developer may not have the
resources to test herself), and then add a note to the ticket asking
the QA team to see if the fix had the desired effect.  Expect a bit of
resistance from some of the developers; programmers have a tendency to
regard QA as, at best, a necessary evil.  The QA team can easily
overcome this by finding significant bugs and filing comprehensible
reports; on the other hand, if their reports are not at least as good
as those coming from the regular user community, then there's no point
having them interact directly with the development team.</p><p>Either way, once a public ticket exists, the original internal
ticket should simply reference the public ticket for technical content.
Management and paid developers may continue to annotate the internal
ticket with company-specific comments as necessary, but use the public
ticket for information that should be available to everyone.</p><p>You should go into this process expecting extra overhead.
Maintaining two tickets for one bug is, naturally, more work than
maintaining one ticket.  The benefit is that many more coders will see
the report and be able to contribute to a solution.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Legal Advice and Protection"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="fund-legal-work"/>Legal Advice and Protection</h2></div></div></div><a id="subsidize-legal"/><p>Corporations, for-profit or nonprofit, are almost the only
entities that ever pay attention to complex legal issues in free
software.  Individual developers often understand the nuances of
various open source licenses, but they generally do not have the time
or resources to competently handle legal issues themselves.  If your
company has a legal department, it can help a project by assisting
with trademark issues, copyright license ownership and compatibility
questions, defense against patent trolls, etc.  If the project decides
to organize formally, or to join an existing umbrella organization,
your legal department can help with issues of corporate law, asset
transfer, reviewing agreements, and other due diligence
matters.</p><p>Some more concrete ideas of what sorts of legal help might be
useful are discussed in <a class="xref" href="">???</a>.  The main thing is to
make sure that communications between the legal department and the
development community, if they happen at all, happen with a mutual
appreciation of the very different universes the parties are coming
from.  On occasion, these two groups talk past each other, each side
assuming domain-specific knowledge that the other does not have.  A
good strategy is to have a liaison (usually a developer, or else a
lawyer with technical expertise) stand in the middle and translate for
as long as needed.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Documentation and Usability"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="fund-documentation-usability"/>Documentation and Usability</h2></div></div></div><a id="subsidize-documentation-usability"/><p>Documentation and usability are both famous weak spots in open
source projects, although I think, at least in the case of
documentation, that the difference between free and proprietary
software is frequently exaggerated.  Nevertheless, it is empirically
true that much open source software lacks first-class documentation
and usability research.</p><p>If your organization wants to help fill these gaps for a
project, probably the best thing it can do is hire people who
are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> regular developers on the project, but
who will be able to interact productively with the developers.
Not hiring regular developers is good for two reasons: one, that way
you don't take development time away from the project; two, those
closest to the software are usually the wrong people to write
documentation or investigate usability anyway, because they have
trouble seeing the software from an outsider's point of view.</p><p>However, it will still be necessary for whoever works on these
problems to communicate with the developers.  Find people who are
technical enough to talk to the coding team, but not so expert in the
software that they can't empathize with regular users anymore.</p><p>A medium-level user is probably the right person to write good
documentation.  In fact, after the first edition of this book was
published, I received the following email from an open source
developer named Dirk Reiners:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>One comment on Money::Documentation and Usability: when we had some 
money to spend and decided that a beginner's tutorial was the most 
critical piece that we needed we hired a medium-level user to write it. 
He had gone through the induction to the system recently enough to 
remember the problems, but he had gotten past them so he knew how to 
describe them. That allowed him to write something that needed only 
minor fixes by the core developers for the things that he hadn't gotten 
right, but still covering the 'obvious' stuff devs would have missed.</p><p>His case was even better, as it had been his job to introduce a bunch of 
other people (students) to the system, so he combined the experience of 
many people, which is something that was just a lucky occurrence and is 
probably hard to get in most cases.</p></blockquote></div><div class="sect3" title="Funding User Experience (UX) Work"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="fund-usability"/>Funding User Experience (UX) Work</h3></div></div></div><p>The field of user experience (<em class="firstterm">UX</em>) design
has lately (as of this writing in early 2014) begun to acquire a new
seriousness of purpose and consistency of professional standards.
Naturally, one thing many companies think of when they want to help
improve an open source project is to fund UX work, since that's just
the sort of thing that projects often overlook or, in some cases,
don't even know they need.</p><p>As with many other types of engagement, do not assume that a UX
expert can be parachuted into the project.  User experience design is
not a checkbox.  It is an attitude taken by a team throughout
development, and one of the primary qualifications to look for in UX
contractors is their ability to gain long-term credibility with the
developers, and to help developers pay attention to user experience
goals.  For example, in addition to their innate domain knowledge, UX
designers often know how to set up and incorporate feedback from user
trials — but those trials will only be effective if
the results are presented to the development team in a way that makes
it easy for the developers to take the results seriously.  This can
only happen through a sustained, two-way interaction, in which UX
experts are subscribed to the appropriate project forums and take the
attitude that they are a kind of specialized developer on the project,
rather than an outside expert providing advice.  Use UX experts who
have worked with open source projects before, if possible.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Providing Hosting/Bandwidth"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="fund-hosting"/>Providing Hosting/Bandwidth</h2></div></div></div><a id="subsidize-hosting"/><p>The inexorable rise of zero-cost canned hosting sites (see <a class="xref" href="ch03s02.html#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">
      بخشی بنام
      “Canned Hosting”
    </a><span> in <a class="xref" href="ch03.html" title="فصل 3. Technical Infrastructure">
      فصل 3, <em>Technical Infrastructure</em></a></span>) for open source
projects has meant that it is increasingly unnecessary for projects to
get corporate support for basic project-hosting infrastructure.  It
still happens sometimes, usually in cases where the company itself
started the project, and is trying to create or keep an association in
the public's mind between the project and the company.  The most
common technique for creating this association is for the company to
host the project's resources under the company's domain name, thus
getting association through the project's URLs.</p><p>While this will cause most users to think of the software as
having <span class="emphasis"><em>something</em></span> to do with your company, it can
also cause a problem: developers are aware of this associative
tendency too, and may not be very comfortable with having the project
hosted under your domain unless you're seriously contributing to the
project—not just bandwidth and server space, but significant
amounts of development time.  After all, there are a lot of free
places to host these days.  The community may eventually feel that the
implied misallocation of credit is not worth the minor convenience
brought by donated hosting, and may even attempt to take the project
elsewhere.  So if you want to provide hosting, do so—but if you
are actually trying to create a public association between your
company and the project, make sure that the level of support you
provide is matched to the amount of credit you claim, whether you
claim it via URL, banner ads, or some other means.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Providing Build Farms and Development Servers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="fund-servers"/>Providing Build Farms and Development Servers</h2></div></div></div><p>Many projects have infrastructure needs beyond just hosting of
code, bug tracker, etc.  For example, projects often use
<em class="firstterm">continuous integration</em> (CI) testing
(a.k.a. <em class="firstterm">build farms</em>) to automatically ensure
that the changes developers are committing both integrate into the
mainline trunk and pass all regression tests<sup>[<a id="idp7186240" href="#ftn.idp7186240" class="footnote">40</a>]</sup>.
However, depending on the size and complexity of the codebase, the
number of developers checking in changes, and other factors, running a
responsive build farm can cost more money than any individual
developer has at their disposal.  A good way to help, and gain some
goodwill in the process, is to donate the server space and bandwith
<span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the technical expertise to set up the
continuous integration and automated testing.  If you don't have the
technical expertise available on staff, you could hire someone from
the project to do it, or at the very least give some of the project's
developers administrative access to the CI servers so they can set
things up themselves.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Sponsoring Conferences, Hackathons, and other Developer Meetings"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="fund-meetings"/>Sponsoring Conferences, Hackathons, and other Developer Meetings</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>30 March 2014: If you're reading this note, then
