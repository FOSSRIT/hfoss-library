available, in the important respects they all say the same things:
that anyone can modify the code, that anyone can redistribute it both
in original and modified form, and that the copyright holders and
authors provide no warranties whatsoever (avoiding liability is
especially important given that people might run modified versions
without even knowing it).  The differences between licences boil down
to a few oft-recurring issues:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">compatibility with proprietary licenses</span></dt><dd><p>The permissive (non-copyleft) free licenses allow the covered code to be
              used in proprietary programs.  This does not affect the
              licensing terms of the proprietary program: it is still
              as proprietary as ever, it just happens to contain some
              code from a non-proprietary source.  The Apache License,
              X Consortium License, BSD-style license, and the
              MIT-style license are all examples of
              proprietary-compatible licenses.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">compatibility with other types of free licenses</span></dt><dd><p>Most of the commonly-used permissive free licenses
              are compatible with each other, meaning that code under
              one license can be combined with code under another, and
              the result distributed under either license without
              violating the terms of the other.  Some of them are also
              compatible with some of the copyleft licenses, meaning
              that a work comprised of code under the permissive
              license and code under the copyleft license can be
              distributed as a combined work under the copyleft
              license (since that's the license that places more
              conditions), with the original code in each case
              remaining under its original license.  Typically these
              compatibility issues come up between some permissive
              license and the GNU General Public License (or its
              variant the <a class="xref" href="ch10s03.html" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">the section called “The GPL and License Compatibility”</a>).  
              This topic is discussed in more detail in
              <a class="xref" href="ch10s03.html" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">the section called “The GPL and License Compatibility”</a><span> later in this chapter</span>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">enforcement of crediting</span></dt><dd><p>Some free licenses stipulate that any use of the
              covered code be accompanied by a notice, whose placement
              and display is usually specified, giving credit to the
              authors or copyright holders of the code.  These
              licenses are often still proprietary-compatible: they do
              not necessarily demand that the derivative work be free,
              merely that credit be given to the free code.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">protection of trademark</span></dt><dd><p>A variant of credit enforcement.
              Trademark-protecting licenses specify that the name of
              the original software (or its copyright holders, or
              their institution, etc.) may <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be
              used to identify derivative works, at least not without
              prior written permission.  This restriction can be
              implemented purely via trademark law anyway, whether or
              not it is also stipulated by the copyright license, so
              such clauses can be somewhat legally
              redundant — in effect, they amplify a
              trademark infringement into a copyright infringement as
              well.</p><p>Although credit enforcement insists that a certain
              name be used, and trademark protection insists that it
              not be used, they are both expressions of the same
              concept: that the original code's reputation be
              preserved, and not tarnished by association.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">patent snapback</span></dt><dd><p>Certain licenses (e.g., the GNU General Public
              License version 3, the Apache License version 2, the
              Mozilla Public License 2.0, and a few others) contain
              language designed
              to prevent people from using patent law to take away the
              rights granted under copyright law by the
              licenses.  They require contributors to grant patent
              licenses along with their contribution, covering any
              patents licenseable by the contributor that would be
              infringed by their contribution (or by the incorporation
              of their contribution into the work as a whole).  Then
              they go further: if someone using software under the
              license initiates patent litigation against another party,
              claiming that the covered work infringes, the initiator
              automatically <span class="emphasis"><em>loses</em></span> all the
              patent grants otherwise provided for that work by the
              license, and in the case of the GPL-3.0 loses their right
              to distribute under the license altogether.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">protection of "artistic integrity"</span></dt><dd><p>Some licenses (the Artistic License, used
              for the most popular implementation of the Perl
              programming language, and Donald Knuth's TeX license,
              for example) require that modification and
              redistribution be done in a manner that distinguishes
              clearly between the pristine original version of the
              code and any modifications.  They permit essentially the
              same freedoms as other free licenses, but impose certain
              requirements that make the integrity of the original
              code easy to verify.  These licenses have not caught on
              much beyond the specific programs they were made for,
              and will not be discussed in this chapter; they are
              mentioned here only for the sake of completeness.  I do
              not recommend licensing new code under them.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Most of these stipulations are not mutually exclusive, and some
licenses include several.  The common thread among them is that they
place demands on the recipient in exchange for the recipient's right
to use and/or redistribute the code.</p></div></body></html>
