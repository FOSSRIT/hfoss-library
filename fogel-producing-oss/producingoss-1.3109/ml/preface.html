them I write free software.  "Oh, yes, open source&#8212;like Linux?"
they say.  I nod eagerly in agreement.  "Yes, exactly!  That's what I
do."  It's nice not to be completely fringe anymore.  In the past, the
next question was usually fairly predictable: "How do you make money
doing that?"  To answer, I'd summarize the economics of open source:
that there are organizations in whose interest it is to have certain
software exist, but that they don't need to sell copies, they just
want to make sure the software is available and maintained, as a tool
instead of a commodity.</p><p>Lately, however, the next question has not always been about
money.  The business case for open source software<sup>[<a name="idp147040" href="#ftn.idp147040" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> is no
longer so mysterious, and many non-programmers already
understand&#8212;or at least are not surprised&#8212;that there are
people employed at it full time.  Instead, the question I have been
hearing more and more often is "<span class="emphasis"><em>Oh, how does that
work?</em></span>"</p><p>I didn't have a satisfactory answer ready, and the harder I
tried to come up with one, the more I realized how complex a topic it
really is.  Running a free software project is not exactly like
running a business (imagine having to constantly negotiate the nature
of your product with a group of volunteers, most of whom you've never
met!).  Nor, for various reasons, is it exactly like running a
traditional non-profit organization, nor a government.  It has
similarities to all these things, but I have slowly come to the
conclusion that free software is <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">sui
generis</em></span>.  There are many things with which it can be
usefully compared, but none with which it can be equated.  Indeed,
even the assumption that free software projects can be "run" is a
stretch.  A free software project can be <span class="emphasis"><em>started</em></span>,
and it can be influenced by interested parties, often quite strongly.
But its assets cannot be made the property of any single owner, and as
long as there are people somewhere&#8212;anywhere&#8212;interested in
continuing it, it cannot be unilaterally shut down.  Everyone has
infinite power; everyone has no power.  It makes for an interesting
dynamic.</p><p>That is why I wanted to write this book.  Free software projects
have evolved a distinct culture, an ethos in which the liberty to make
the software do anything one wants is a central tenet, and yet the
result of this liberty is not a scattering of individuals each going
their own separate way with the code, but enthusiastic collaboration.
Indeed, competence at cooperation itself is one of the most highly
valued skills in free software.  To manage these projects is to engage
in a kind of hypertrophied cooperation, where one's ability not only
to work with others but to come up with new ways of working together
can result in tangible benefits to the software.  This book attempts
to describe the techniques by which this may be done.  It is by no
means complete, but it is at least a beginning.</p><p>Good free software is a worthy goal in itself, and I hope that
readers who come looking for ways to achieve it will be satisfied with
what they find here.  But beyond that I also hope to convey something
of the sheer pleasure to be had from working with a motivated team of
open source developers, and from interacting with users in the
wonderfully direct way that open source encourages.  Participating in
a successful free software project is
<span class="emphasis"><em>fun</em></span>, and ultimately that's what keeps the whole
system going.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp147040" href="#idp147040" class="para">1</a>] </sup>The
