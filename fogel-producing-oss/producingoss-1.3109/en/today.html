about such weighty philosophical matters on a daily basis.
Programmers will not insist that everyone else in the project agree
with their views on all things (those who do insist on this quickly
find themselves unable to work in any project).  But you do need to be
aware that the question of "free" versus "open source" exists, partly
to avoid saying things that might be inimical to some of the
participants, and partly because understanding developers' motivations
is the best way &#8212; in some sense, the <span class="emphasis"><em>only</em></span>
way &#8212; to manage a project.</p><p>Free software is a culture by choice.  To operate successfully
in it, you have to understand why people choose to be in it in the
first place.  Coercive techniques don't work.  If people are unhappy in
one project, they will just wander off to another one.  Free software
is remarkable even among intentional communities for its lightness of
investment.  Many of the people involved have never actually met the
other participants face-to-face.  The normal conduits by which humans bond
with each other and form lasting groups are narrowed down to a tiny
channel: the written word, carried over electronic wires.  Because of
this, it can take a long time for a cohesive and dedicated group to
form.  Conversely, it's quite easy for a project to lose a potential
participant in the first five minutes of acquaintanceship.  If a project
doesn't make a good first impression, newcomers may wait a long time
before giving it a second chance.</p><p>The transience, or rather the <span class="emphasis"><em>potential</em></span>
transience, of relationships is perhaps the single most daunting task
facing a new project.  What will persuade all these people to stick
together long enough to produce something useful?  The answer to that
question is complex enough to occupy the rest of this book, but if it
had to be expressed in one sentence, it would be this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>People should feel that their connection to a
      project, and influence over it, is directly proportional to
      their contributions.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>No class of developers, or potential developers, should ever
feel discounted or discriminated against for non-technical
reasons<sup>[<a name="idp289" href="#ftn.idp289" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup>.
Clearly, projects with corporate
sponsorship and/or salaried developers need to be especially careful
in this regard, as <a class="xref" href="money.html" title="Chapter 5. Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency">Chapter 5, <i>Participating as a Business, Non-Profit, or Government Agency</i></a> discusses in detail.  Of
course, this doesn't mean that if there's no corporate sponsorship
then you have nothing to worry about.  Money is merely one of many
factors that can affect the success of a project.  There are also
questions of what language to choose, what license, what development
process, precisely what kind of infrastructure to set up, how to
publicize the project's inception effectively, and much more.
Starting a project out on the right foot is the topic of <a class="link" href="getting-started.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">the next chapter</a>.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp289" href="#idp289" class="para">12</a>] </sup>There can be cases where you discriminate
against certain developers due to behavior which, though not related
to their technical contributions, has the potential to harm the
project.  That's reasonable: their behavior is relevant because in the
long run it will have a negative effect on the project.  The varieties
of human culture being what they are, I can give no single, succint
rule to cover all such cases, except to say that you should try to be
welcoming to all potential contributors and, if you must discriminate,
do so only on the basis of actual behavior, not on the basis of a
contributor's group affiliation or group identity.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="introduction.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="introduction.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="getting-started.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 1. Introduction </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 2. Getting Started</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
