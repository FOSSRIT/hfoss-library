licensing, trademark, and patent issues.  Although I hope it contains
enough information to get you started on your own open source project,
any serious investigation of legal issues will quickly exhaust what
this book can provide.  Here are some other resources:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://opensource.org/licenses">opensource.org/licenses</a></p><p>The OSI license introduction page is a
            well-maintained source of information about widely used
            open source licenses, and offers answers to frequently
            asked questions.  It's a good place to start if you have a
            general idea of what open source licenses do, but now need
            more information, for example to choose a license for your
            project.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><em class="citetitle"> Intellectual Property and Open Source:
