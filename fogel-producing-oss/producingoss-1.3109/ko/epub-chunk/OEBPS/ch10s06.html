Developer Certificates of Origin (DCOs) too.</em></span></p><p>There are three ways to handle copyright ownership for free code
and documentation that were contributed to by many people.  The first
is to ignore the issue of copyright entirely (I don't recommend this).
The second is to collect a <em class="firstterm">contributor license
agreement</em> (<em class="firstterm">CLA</em>) from each person
who works on the project, explicitly granting the project the right to
use that person's contributions.  This is usually enough for most
projects, and the nice thing is that in some jurisdictions, CLAs can
be sent in by email.  The third way is to get actual
<em class="firstterm">copyright assignment</em> (<em class="firstterm">CA</em>
from contributors, so that the project (i.e., some legal entity,
usually a nonprofit) is the copyright owner for everything.  This way
is the most burdensome for contributors, and some contributors simply
refuse to do it; only a few projects still ask for assignment, and I don't
recommend that any project require it these days.<sup>[<a id="idp9551632" href="#ftn.idp9551632" class="footnote">69</a>]</sup></p><p>Note that even under centralized copyright ownership, the
code<sup>[<a id="idp9552640" href="#ftn.idp9552640" class="footnote">70</a>]</sup> remains free, because
open source licenses do not give the copyright holder the right to
retroactively proprietize all copies of the code.  So even if the
project, as a legal entity, were to suddenly turn around and start
distributing all the code under a restrictive license, that wouldn't
cause a problem for the public community.  The other developers would
simply start a fork based on the latest free copy of the code, and
continue as if nothing had happened.</p><div class="sect2" title="Doing Nothing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="copyright-assignment-none"/>Doing Nothing</h2></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>possv2 todo 6 Sep 2014: I'm not so sure about the
advice in this section anymore.  The legal landscape has changed, and
I've learned more.  For the moment I'm letting it stand, until I have
a chance to talk to a few more people.</em></span></p><p>Most projects never collect CLAs or CAs from
their contributors.  Instead, they accept code whenever it seems
reasonably clear that the contributor intended it to be incorporated
into the project.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this is okay.  But every now and
then, someone may decide to sue for copyright infringement, alleging
that they are the true owner of the code in question and that they
never agreed to its being distributed by the project under an open
source license.  For example, the SCO Group did something like this to
the Linux project, see
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies</a>
for details.  When this happens, the project will have no
documentation showing that the contributor formally granted the right
to use the code, which could make some legal defenses more
difficult.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Contributor License Agreements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="copyright-assignment-cla"/>Contributor License Agreements</h2></div></div></div><p>CLAs probably offer the best tradeoff between safety and
convenience.  A CLA is typically an electronic form that a developer
fills out and sends in to the project.  In many jurisdictions, email
submission or an online form is enough.  A secure digital signature
may or may not be required; consult a lawyer to find out what method
would be best for `your project.</p><p>Most projects use two slightly different CLAs, one for
individuals, and one for corporate contributors.  But in both types,
the core language is the same: the contributor grants the
project a <span class="emphasis"><em>"...perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute [the] Contributions and such derivative
works."</em></span> Again, you should have a lawyer approve any CLA,
but if you get all those adjectives into it, you're off to a good start.</p><p>When you request CLAs from contributors, make sure to emphasize
that you are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> asking for actual copyright
assignment.  In fact, many CLAs start out by reminding the reader of
this:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This is a license agreement only; it does not transfer
