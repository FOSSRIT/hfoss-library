이 책은 오픈소스 프로젝트를 고려하고 있거나 또는 프로젝트를 하나 시작했고 이제 어떻게 할지 고민하고 있는 소프트웨어 개발자들이나 관리자를 위한 책이다.

a developer, is not necessary.  Those who have worked in free software
projects before will probably find at least some parts of the book a
bit obvious, and may want to skip those sections.  Because there's
such a potentially wide range of audience experience, I've made an
effort to label sections clearly, and to say when something can be
skipped by those already familiar with the material.</p></div></body></html>
