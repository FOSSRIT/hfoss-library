and documentation that were contributed to by many people.  The first
is to ignore the issue of copyright entirely (I don't recommend this).
The second is to collect a <em class="firstterm">contributor license
agreement</em> (<em class="firstterm">CLA</em>) from each person
who works on the project, explicitly granting the project the right to
use that person's contributions.  This is usually enough for most
projects, and the nice thing is that in some jurisdictions, CLAs can
be sent in by email.  The third way is to get actual
<em class="firstterm">copyright assignment</em> (<em class="firstterm">CA</em>
from contributors, so that the project (i.e., some legal entity,
usually a nonprofit) is the copyright owner for everything.  This way
is the most burdensome for contributors, and some contributors simply
refuse to do it; only a few projects still ask for assignment, and I don't
recommend that any project require it these days.<sup>[<a name="idp4003" href="#ftn.idp4003" class="footnote">102</a>]</sup></p><p>Note that even under centralized copyright ownership, the
code<sup>[<a name="idp4006" href="#ftn.idp4006" class="footnote">103</a>]</sup> remains free, because
open source licenses do not give the copyright holder the right to
retroactively proprietize all copies of the code.  So even if the
project, as a legal entity, were to suddenly turn around and start
distributing all the code under a restrictive license, that wouldn't
necessarily cause a problem for the public community.  The other
developers can start a fork based on the latest free copy of the code,
and continue as if nothing had happened.</p><div class="sect2" title="Doing Nothing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="copyright-assignment-none"></a>Doing Nothing</h3></div></div></div><p>Some projects never collect CLAs or CAs from
their contributors.  Instead, they accept code whenever it seems
reasonably clear that the contributor intended it to be incorporated
into the project.</p><p>This can seem to work for a long time, as long as the project
has no enemies.  But I don't recommend it.  Someone may eventually
decide to sue for copyright infringement, alleging that they are the
true owner of the code in question and that they never agreed to its
being distributed by the project under an open source license.  For
example, the SCO Group did something like this to the Linux project, see
<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO-Linux_controversies</a>
for details.  When this happens, the project will have no
documentation showing that the contributor formally granted the right
to use the code, which could make some legal defenses more
difficult.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Contributor License Agreements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="copyright-assignment-cla"></a>Contributor License Agreements</h3></div></div></div><p>CLAs probably offer the best tradeoff between safety and
convenience.  A CLA is typically an electronic form that a developer
fills out and sends in to the project, or even a web-based checkbox
that the developer checks before completing their first contribution
to the project.  In many jurisdictions, such email
submission or an online form is enough, though you should consult with
a lawyer to see what method would be best for your project.</p><p>Some projects use two slightly different CLAs, one for
individuals, and one for corporate contributors.  But in both types,
the core language is the same: the contributor grants the
project a <span class="emphasis"><em>"...perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
and distribute [the] Contributions and such derivative
works."</em></span> Again, you should have a lawyer approve any CLA,
but if you get all those adjectives into it, you're off to a good start.</p><p>When you request CLAs from contributors, make sure to emphasize
that you are <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> asking for actual copyright
assignment.  In fact, many CLAs start out by reminding the reader of
this, for example like so:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>This is a license agreement only; it does not transfer
copyright ownership and does not change your rights to use your own
Contributions for any other purpose.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><div class="sect3" title="Developer Certificates of Origin (DCO): A Simpler Style of CLA"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="developer-certificate-of-origin"></a>Developer Certificates of Origin (DCO): A Simpler Style of CLA</h4></div></div></div><p>More and more projects are now using a particularly convenient
style of simple CLA known as a <em class="firstterm">Developer Certificate of
Origin</em> (<em class="firstterm">DCO</em>).</p><p>A DCO is essentially an attestation that the contributor intends
to contribute the enclosed code under the project's license, and that
the contributor has the right to do so.  The contributor indicates her
understanding of the DCO once, early on, for example by emailing its
text from her usual contribution address to a special archive at the
project<sup>[<a name="idp4029" href="#ftn.idp4029" class="footnote">104</a>]</sup>.
Thereafter, the contributor includes a "Signed-Off-By:" line in her
patches or commits, using the same identity, to indicate that the
corresponding contribution is certified under the DCO.  This gives the
project the legal cover it needs, while giving contributors a
low-bureaucracy process for submitting their contributions.  The DCO
relies on the project's native open source license for any trademark
or patent provisions, which in most cases is fine.</p><p>The simplification that makes DCOs work so well is that they set
the inbound license of the contribution to be the same as the outbound
license of the project.  This avoids the sticky issues that a more
complex CLA can create, whereby the recipient of the CLA might reserve
the right to relicense the project (and thus all the past
contributions) under some different license in the future, possibly
even a proprietary license.  DCOs are probably the minimum amount of
CLA a free software project should adopt, but for some circumstances a
more complex CLA may still be the better course.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp4003" href="#idp4003" class="para">102</a>] </sup>Also,
