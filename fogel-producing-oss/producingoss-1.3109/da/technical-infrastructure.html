selective capture and integration of information.  The more skilled
you are at using these technologies, and at persuading others to use
them, the more successful your project will be.  This only becomes
more true as the project grows.  Good information management is what
prevents open source projects from collapsing under the weight of
Brooks' Law,<sup>[<a name="idp5540496" href="#ftn.idp5540496" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup>
which states that adding manpower to a late software project makes it
later.  Fred Brooks observed that the complexity of a project
increases as the <span class="emphasis"><em>square</em></span> of the number of
participants.  When only a few people are involved, everyone can easily
talk to everyone else, but when hundreds of people are involved, it is
no longer possible for each person to remain constantly aware of what
everyone else is doing.  If good free software project management is
about making everyone feel like they're all working together in the
same room, the obvious question is: what happens when everyone in a
crowded room tries to talk at once?</p><p>This problem is not new.  In non-metaphorical crowded rooms, the
solution is <em class="firstterm">parliamentary procedure</em>: formal
guidelines for how to have real-time discussions in large groups, how
to make sure important dissents are not lost in floods of "me-too"
comments, how to form subcommittees, how to recognize when decisions
are made, etc.  An important part of parliamentary procedure is
specifying how the group interacts with its information management
system.  Some remarks are made "for the record", others are not.  The
record itself is subject to direct manipulation, and is understood to
be not a literal transcript of what occurred, but a representation of
what the group is willing to <span class="emphasis"><em>agree</em></span> occurred.  The
record is not monolithic, but takes different forms for different
purposes.  It comprises the minutes of individual meetings, the
complete collection of all minutes of all meetings, summaries, agendas
and their annotations, committee reports, reports from correspondents
not present, lists of action items, etc.</p><p>Because the Internet is not really a room, we don't have to
worry about replicating those parts of parliamentary procedure that
keep some people quiet while others are speaking.  But when it comes
to information management techniques, well-run open source projects
are parliamentary procedure on steroids.  Since almost all
communication in open source projects happens in writing, elaborate
systems have evolved for routing and labeling data appropriately; for
minimizing repetitions so as to avoid spurious divergences; for
storing and retrieving data; for correcting bad or obsolete
information; and for associating disparate bits of information with
each other as new connections are observed.  Active participants in
open source projects internalize many of these techniques, and will
often perform complex manual tasks to ensure that information is
routed correctly.  But the whole endeavor ultimately depends on
sophisticated software support.  As much as possible, the
communications media themselves should do the routing, labeling, and
recording, and should make the information available to humans in the
most convenient way possible.  In practice, of course, humans will
still need to intervene at many points in the process, and it's
important that the software make such interventions convenient too.
But in general, if the humans take care to label and route information
accurately on its first entry into the system, then the software
should be configured to make as much use of that metadata as
possible.</p><p>The advice in this chapter is intensely practical, based on
experiences with specific software and usage patterns.  But the point
is not just to teach a particular collection of techniques.  It is
also to demonstrate, by means of many small examples, the overall
attitude that will best encourage good information management in your
project.  This attitude will involve a combination of technical skills
and people skills.  The technical skills are essential because
information management software always requires configuration, plus a
certain amount of ongoing maintenance and tweaking as new needs arise
(for example, see the discussion of how to handle project growth in
<a class="xref" href="bug-tracker.html#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">&#8220;Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker&#8221;</a><span> later in
this chapter</span>).  The people skills are necessary
because the human community also requires maintenance: it's not always
immediately obvious how to use these tools to full advantage, and in
some cases projects have conflicting conventions (for example, see the
discussion of setting <code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> headers on
outgoing mailing list posts, in <a class="xref" href="mailing-lists.html" title="Mailing Lists">&#8220;Mailing Lists&#8221;</a>).
Everyone involved with the project will need to be encouraged, at the
right times and in the right ways, to do their part to keep the
project's information well organized.  The more involved the
contributor, the more complex and specialized the techniques she can
be expected to learn.</p><p>Information management has no cut-and-dried solution.  There are
too many variables.  You may finally get everything configured just
the way you want it, and have most of the community participating, but
then project growth will make some of those practices unscalable.  Or
project growth may stabilize, and the developer and user communities
settle into a comfortable relationship with the technical
infrastructure, but then someone will come along and invent a whole
new information management service, and pretty soon newcomers will be
asking why your project doesn't use it&#8212;for example, this is
happening now to a lot of free software projects that predate the
invention of the wiki (see
<a class="ulink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki" target="_top">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a>).  Many questions are
matters of judgement, involving tradeoffs between the convenience of
those producing information and the convenience of those consuming it,
or between the time required to configure information management
software and the benefit it brings to the project.</p><p>Beware of the temptation to over-automate, that is, to automate
things that really require human attention.  Technical infrastructure
is important, but what makes a free software project work is
care&#8212;and intelligent expression of that care&#8212;by the humans
involved.  The technical infrastructure is mainly about giving humans
convenient ways to do that.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="What a Project Needs"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="tools-needed"></a>What a Project Needs</h2></div></div></div><p>Most open source projects offer at least a minimum, standard set
of tools for managing information:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Web site</span></dt><dd><p>Primarily a centralized, one-way conduit of
           information from the project out to the public.  The web
           site may also serve as an administrative interface for
           other project tools.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Mailing lists</span></dt><dd><p>Usually the most active communications forum in the
             project, and the "medium of record."</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Version control</span></dt><dd><p>Enables developers to manage code changes conveniently,
             including reverting and "change porting".  Enables
             everyone to watch what's happening to the code.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Bug tracking</span></dt><dd><p>Enables developers to keep track of what they're working
             on, coordinate with each other, and plan releases.  Enables
             everyone to query the status of bugs and record
             information (e.g., reproduction recipes) about particular
             bugs.  Can be used for tracking not only bugs, but also
             tasks, releases, new features, etc.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Real-time chat</span></dt><dd><p>A place for quick, lightweight discussions and
             question/answer exchanges.  Not always archived
             completely.</p></dd></dl></div><p>Each tool in this set addresses a distinct need, but their functions
are also interrelated, and the tools must be made to work together.
Below we will examine how they can do so, and more importantly, how to
get people to use them.  The web site is not discussed until the end,
since it acts more as glue for the other components than as a tool
unto itself.</p><p>You may be able to avoid a lot of the headache of choosing and
configuring these tools by using a <em class="firstterm">canned
hosting</em> site: a server that offers prepackaged,
templatized web areas with all the accompanying tools needed to run a
free software project.  See
<a class="xref" href="web-site.html#canned-hosting" title="Canned Hosting">&#8220;Canned Hosting&#8221;</a><span> later

disadvantages of canned hosting.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp5540496" href="#idp5540496" class="para">13</a>] </sup>From his book <em class="citetitle">The Mythical Man
