corporate support.  This list is just a high-level survey.  The items
in it aren't mutually exclusive; often a project's financial backing
will result from several, or even all, of these motivations:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">Sharing the burden</span></dt><dd><p>Separate organizations with related software needs often
     find themselves duplicating effort, either by redundantly writing
     similar code in-house, or by purchasing similar products from
     proprietary vendors.  When they realize what's going on, the
     organizations may pool their resources and create (or join) an
     open source project tailored to their needs.  The advantages are
     obvious: the costs of development are divided, but the benefits
     accrue to all.  Although this scenario might seem most intuitive for
     nonprofits, it often makes strategic sense even for for-profit
     competitors.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Augmenting services</span></dt><dd><p>When a company sells services which depend on, or are made
     more attractive by, particular open source programs, it is
     naturally in that company's interests to ensure those programs
     are actively maintained.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Creating an ecosystem</span></dt><dd><p>For investors who like to think big, the right open source
     effort can create a new ecosystem &#8212; one in which
     those investors are more likely to flourish.  A good example of
     this kind of investment, as of this writing in 2014, is the
     <a class="ulink" href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_top">Meteor.com</a>
     project.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Supporting hardware sales</span></dt><dd><p>The value of computers and computer components is directly
     related to the amount of software available for them.  Hardware
     vendors&#8212;not just whole-machine vendors, but also makers
     of peripheral devices and microchips&#8212;have found that
     having high-quality free software to run on their hardware is
     important to customers.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Undermining a competitor</span></dt><dd><p>Sometimes companies support a particular open source
     project as a means of undermining a competitor's product, which
     may or may not be open source itself.  Eating away at a
     competitor's market share is usually not the sole reason for
     getting involved with an open source project, but it can be a
     factor.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Marketing</span></dt><dd><p>Having your company associated with a popular open source
     application can be simply good brand management.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Dual-licensing</span></dt><dd><p><em class="firstterm">Dual-licensing</em> is the practice of
     offering software under a traditional proprietary license for
     customers who want to resell it as part of a proprietary
     application of their own, and simultaneously under a free license
     for those willing to use it under open source terms (see <a class="xref" href="">???</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="">???</a></span>).  If the open source developer
     community is active, the software gets the benefits of wide-area
     debugging and development, yet the company still gets a royalty
     stream to support some full-time programmers.</p><p>Dual-licensing is controversial because it is not a "pure
     open source play" (as we say in business-speak), but rather yokes
     funding for open source development to a monopoly-based revenue
     stream.  Whether this is a problem for you depends on where you
     fall on the "open source is just a way of software development"
     to "open source is a way of life" spectrum.  The presence of
     revenue from a proprietary version does not necessarily mean that
     the free software version is worse off, and some very well-known
     and widely-used free software has had corresponding proprietary
     versions (<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL" target="_top">MySQL</a> is probably the most famous example).  However,
     some developers dislike the thought that their contributions may
     end up in the proprietary version.  Also, the mere presence of
     the proprietary version suggests the possibility that some of the
     best salaried developers' attention is going to the proprietary
     code, not the open source code, and this can undermine other
     developers' faith in the open source project.</p><p>None of is meant to persuade you not to do dual-licensing.
     You should just be aware that dual-licensing strategies are
     unlike the other business approaches I've listed here, and that
     it probably requires more care and sophistication to manage
     successfully.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Donations</span></dt><dd><p>A widely-used project can sometimes get significant
     contributions, from both individuals and organizations, just by
     soliciting donations, or by doing an organized crowdfunding
     campaign (e.g., via <a class="ulink" href="http://bountysource.com/" target="_top">Bountysource</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://indiegogo.com/" target="_top">IndieGoGo</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://kickstarter.com/" target="_top">Kickstarter</a>, etc)<sup>[<a name="idp7558096" href="#ftn.idp7558096" class="footnote">39</a>]</sup>.  A word of
     caution: if your project accepts donations, do some public
     planning of how the money will be used
     <span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> it comes in.  Discussions about how
     to allocate money tend to go a lot more smoothly when held before
     there's actual money to spend; and anyway, if there are
     significant disagreements, it's better to find that out when the
     money is still theoretical than when it's real.</p></dd></dl></div><p>A funder's business model is not the only factor in how that
funder relates to an open source community.  The historical relationship
between the two also matters: did the company start the project, or is
it joining an existing development effort?  In both cases, the funder
will have to earn credibility, but, not surprisingly, there's a bit
more earning to be done in the latter case.  The organization needs to
have clear goals with respect to the project.  Is the company trying
to keep a position of leadership, or simply trying to be one voice in
the community, to guide but not necessarily govern the project's
direction?  Or does it just want to have a couple of committers
around, able to fix customers' bugs and get the changes into the
public distribution without any fuss?</p><p>Keep these questions in mind as you read the guidelines that
follow.  They are meant to apply to any sort of organizational
involvement in a free software project, but every project is a human
environment, and therefore no two are exactly alike.  To some degree,
you will always have to play by ear, but following these principles
will increase the likelihood of things turning out the way you
want.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="right"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp7558096" href="#idp7558096" class="para">39</a>] </sup>Aaron Wolf's <a class="ulink" href="http://snowdrift.coop/" target="_top">Snowdrift.coop</a> is a recent
     and interesting new approach to crowdfunding for libre projects.
     It focuses on sustainability beyond initial funding, by
     harnessing a limited positive feedback loop: pool donations are
     re-allocated, up to per-donor limits, depending on which projects
     people indicate support for.  It's still in its early stages, so
     it's too early to tell if it will fly, but I thought it deserved
     a footnote.  Check it out; by the time these words are published,
     Snowdrift might be out of alpha.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="right"><a accesskey="p" href="money.html">&#1602;&#1576;&#1604;&#1740;</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="money.html">&#1576;&#1575;&#1604;&#1575;</a></td><td width="40%" align="left"> <a accesskey="n" href="long-term-developers.html">&#1576;&#1593;&#1583;&#1740;</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top">
