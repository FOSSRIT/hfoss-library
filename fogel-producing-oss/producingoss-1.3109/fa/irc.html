<em class="firstterm">Internet Relay Chat</em>
(<em class="firstterm">IRC</em>), forums where users and developers can
ask each other questions and get instant responses.  IRC has been
around for a long time, and its primarily text-based interface and
command language can look old-fashioned &#8212; but don't be
fooled: the number of people using IRC continues to
grow<sup>[<a name="idp6674976" href="#ftn.idp6674976" class="footnote">30</a>]</sup>,
and it is a key communications forum for many open source projects.
It's generally the only place where developers can meet in a shared
space for real-time conversation on a regular basis.</p><p>If you've never used IRC before, don't be daunted.  It's not
hard; although there isn't space in this book for an IRC primer,
<a class="ulink" href="http://irchelp.org/" target="_top">irchelp.org</a> is a good guide
to IRC usage and administration, and in particular see the tutorial at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html" target="_top">irchelp.org/irchelp/irctutorial.html</a>.  While in theory your
project <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> run its own IRC servers, it is
generally not worth the hassle.  Instead, just do what everyone else
does: host your project's IRC channels<sup>[<a name="idp6678928" href="#ftn.idp6678928" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup> at Freenode (<a class="ulink" href="http://freenode.net/" target="_top">freenode.net</a>).  Freenode gives you
the control you need to administer your project's IRC channels, while
sparing you the not-insignificant trouble of maintaining an IRC server
yourself.</p><p>The first thing to do is choose a channel name.  The most
obvious choice is the name of your project&#8212;if that's available
at Freenode, then use it.  If not, try to choose something as close to
your project's name, and as easy to remember, as possible.  Advertise
the channel's availabity from your project's web site, so a visitor
with a quick question will see it right away.<sup>[<a name="idp6670064" href="#ftn.idp6670064" class="footnote">32</a>]</sup>.  If your project's channel gets
too noisy, you can divide into multiple channels, for example one for
installation problems, another for usage questions, another for
development chat, etc (<a class="xref" href="growth.html" title="Handling Growth">
      &#1576;&#1582;&#1588;&#1740; &#1576;&#1606;&#1575;&#1605;

      &#1601;&#1589;&#1604; 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>
discusses when and how to divide into multiple channels).  But when
your project is young, there should only be one channel, with everyone
talking together.  Later, as the user-to-developer ratio increases,
separate channels may become necessary.</p><p>How will people know all the available channels, let alone which
channel to talk in?  And when they talk, how will they know what the
local conventions are?</p><p>The answer is to tell them by setting the <em class="firstterm">channel
topic</em>.<sup>[<a name="idp6687744" href="#ftn.idp6687744" class="footnote">33</a>]</sup>  The channel topic is a brief
message each user sees when they first enter the channel.  It gives
quick guidance to newcomers, and pointers to further information.  For
example:</p><pre class="screen">
The Apache (TM) Subversion (R) version control system
(http://subversion.apache.org/) | Don't ask to ask; just ask your
question! | Read the book: http://www.svnbook.org/ | No one here? Try
http://subversion.apache.org/mailing-lists |
http://subversion.apache.org/faq | Subversion 1.8.8 and 1.7.16 released
</pre><p>That's terse, but it tells newcomers what they need to know.  It
says exactly what the channel is for, gives the project home page (in
case someone wanders into the channel without having first been to the
project web site), gives a pointer to some documentation, and gives
recent release news.</p><div class="sidebar" title="Paste Sites"><a name="paste-sites"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><b>Paste Sites</b></p></div></div></div><p>An IRC channel is a shared space: everyone can see what everyone
else is saying.  Normally, this is a good thing, as it allows people
to jump into a conversation when they think they have something to
contribute, and allows spectators to learn by watching.  But it
becomes problematic when someone has to provide a large quantity of
information at once, such as a large error message or a transcript
from a debugging session, because pasting too many lines of output
into the room will disrupt other conversations.</p><p>The solution is to use one of the
<em class="firstterm">pastebin</em> or <em class="firstterm">pastebot</em>
sites.  When requesting a large amount of data from someone, ask them
not to paste it into the channel, but instead to go to (for example)
<a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.ca/" target="_top">pastebin.ca</a>, paste their
data into the form there, and tell the resulting new URL to the IRC
channel.  Anyone can then visit the URL and view the data.</p><p>There are many free paste sites available, far too many for a
comprehensive list.  Three that I seen used a lot are GitHub Gists
(<a class="ulink" href="https://gist.github.com/" target="_top">gist.github.com</a>),
<a class="ulink" href="http://paste.lisp.org/" target="_top">paste.lisp.org</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://pastebin.ca/" target="_top">pastebin.ca</a>.  But there are many
other fine ones, and it's okay if different people in your IRC channel
choose to use different paste sites.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="IRC Bots"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="irc-bots"></a>IRC Bots</h3></div></div></div><a name="bots"></a><p>Many technically-oriented IRC channels have a non-human member,
a so-called <em class="firstterm">bot</em>, that is capable of storing and
regurgitating information in response to specific commands.
Typically, the bot is addressed just like any other member of the
channel, that is, the commands are delivered by "speaking to" the bot.
For example:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; wayita: learn diff-cmd = http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; Thanks!
</pre><p>That told the bot, who is logged into the channel as wayita, to
remember a certain URL as the answer to the query "diff-cmd" (wayita
responded, confirming with a "Thanks!").  Now we can address wayita,
asking the bot to tell another user about diff-cmd:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; wayita: tell jrandom about diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; jrandom: http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre><p>The same thing can be accomplished via a convenient shorthand:</p><pre class="screen">
&lt;kfogel&gt; !a jrandom diff-cmd
&lt;wayita&gt; jrandom: http://subversion.apache.org/faq.html#diff-cmd
</pre><p>The exact command set and behaviors differ from bot to bot
(unfortunately, the diversity of IRC bot command languages seems to be
rivaled only by the diversity of wiki syntaxes).  The above example
happens to be with <code class="literal">wayita</code> (<a class="ulink" href="http://repos.borg.ch/svn/wayita/trunk/" target="_top">repos.borg.ch/svn/wayita/trunk</a>), of which there is usually an
instance running in <code class="literal">#svn</code> at Freenode, but there are
many other IRC bots available.  Note that no special server privileges
are required to run a bot.  A bot is just like any other user joining
a channel.</p><p>If your channel tends to get the same questions over and over,
I highly recommend setting up a bot.  Only a small percentage of
channel users will acquire the expertise needed to manipulate the bot,
but those users will answer a disproportionately high percentage of
questions, because the bot enables them to respond so much more
efficiently.</p><div class="sect3" title="Commit Notifications in IRC"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="irc-commit-notifications"></a>Commit Notifications in IRC</h4></div></div></div><a name="cia"></a><p>You can also configure a bot to watch your project's version
control repository and broadcast commit activity to the relevant IRC
channels.  Though of somewhat less technical utility than commit
emails, since observers might or might not be around when a commit
notice pops up in IRC, this technique is of immense
<span class="emphasis"><em>social</em></span> utility.  People get the sense of being
part of something alive and active, and feel that they can see
progress being made right before their eyes.  And because the
notifications appear in a shared space, people in the chat room will
often react in real time, reviewing the commit and commenting on it on
the spot.  The technical details of setting this up are beyond the
scope of this book, but it's usually worth the effort.  This service
used to be provided in an easy-to-use way by the much-missed <a class="ulink" href="http://cia.vc/" target="_top">cia.vc</a>, which shut down in 2011, but
several replacements are available: Notifico (<a class="ulink" href="http://n.tkte.ch/" target="_top">n.tkte.ch</a>), Irker (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.catb.org/esr/irker/" target="_top">catb.org/esr/irker</a>), and
KGB (<a class="ulink" href="http://kgb.alioth.debian.org/" target="_top">kgb.alioth.debian.org</a>).</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Archiving IRC"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="irc-archiving"></a>Archiving IRC</h3></div></div></div><p>Although it is possible to publicly archive everything that
happens in an IRC channel, it's not necessarily expected.  IRC
conversations are nominally public, but many people think of them as
informal and ephemeral conversations.  Users may be careless with
grammar, and often express opinions (for example, about other software
or other programmers) that they wouldn't want preserved forever in a
searchable online archive.  Of course, there will sometimes be
<span class="emphasis"><em>excerpts</em></span> that get quoted elsewhere, and that's
fine.  But indiscriminate public logging may make some users uneasy.
If you do archive everything, make sure you state so clearly in the
channel topic, and give a URL to the archive.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="right"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp6674976" href="#idp6674976" class="para">30</a>] </sup>See <a class="ulink" href="http://freenode.net/history.shtml" target="_top">freenode.net/history.shtml</a> for example.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp6678928" href="#idp6678928" class="para">31</a>] </sup>An IRC

which of those channels to join, or her client software remembers and
