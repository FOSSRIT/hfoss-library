picking a license, arranging the initial web site, etc.  But the most
important aspects of starting a new project are dynamic.  Choosing a
mailing list address is easy; ensuring that the list's conversations
remain on-topic and productive is another matter entirely.  For
example, if the project is being opened up after years of closed,
in-house development, its development processes will change, and you
will have to prepare the existing developers for that change.</p><p>The first steps are the hardest, because precedents and
expectations for future conduct have not yet been set.  Stability in a
project does not come from formal policies, but from a shared,
hard-to-pin-down collective wisdom that develops over time.  There are
often written rules as well, but they tend to be essentially a
distillation of the intangible, ever-evolving agreements that really
guide the project.  The written policies do not define the project's
culture so much as describe it, and even then only
approximately.</p><p>There are a few reasons why things work out this way.  Growth
and high turnover are not as damaging to the accumulation of social
norms as one might think.  As long as change does not happen
<span class="emphasis"><em>too</em></span> quickly, there is time for new arrivals to
learn how things are done, and after they learn, they will help
reinforce those ways themselves.  Consider how children's songs
survive for centuries.  There are children today singing roughly the
same rhymes as children did hundreds of years ago, even though there
are no children alive now who were alive then.  Younger children hear
the songs sung by older ones, and when they are older, they in turn
will sing them in front of other younger ones.  The children are not
engaging in a conscious program of transmission, of course, but the
reason the songs survive is nonetheless that they are transmitted
regularly and repeatedly.  The time scale of free software projects
may not be measured in centuries (we don't know yet), but the dynamics
of transmission are much the same.  The turnover rate is faster,
however, and must be compensated for by a more active and deliberate
transmission effort.</p><p>This effort is aided by the fact that people generally show up
expecting and looking for social norms.  That's just how humans are
built.  In any group unified by a common endeavor, people who join
instinctively search for behaviors that will mark them as part of the
group.  The goal of setting precedents early is to make those
"in-group" behaviors be ones that are useful to the project; once
established, they will be largely self-perpetuating.</p><p>Following are some examples of specific things you can do to set
good precedents.  They're not meant as an exhaustive list, just as
illustrations of the idea that setting a collaborative mood early
helps a project tremendously.  Physically, every developer may be
working alone in a room by themselves, but you can do a lot to make
them <span class="emphasis"><em>feel</em></span> like they're all working together in
the same room.  The more they feel this way, the more time they'll
want to spend on the project.  I chose these particular examples
because they came up in the Subversion project (<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org/</a>),
which I participated in and observed from its very beginning.  But
they're not unique to Subversion; situations like these will come up
in most open source projects, and should be seen as opportunities to
start things off on the right foot.</p><div class="sect2" title="Avoid Private Discussions"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="avoid-private-discussions"></a>Avoid Private Discussions</h3></div></div></div><p>Even after you've taken the project public, you and the other
founders will often find yourselves wanting to settle difficult
questions by private communications among an inner circle.  This is
especially true in the early days of the project, when there are so
many important decisions to make, and, usually, few people
qualified to make them.  All the obvious disadvantages of public list
discussions will loom palpably in front of you: the delay inherent in
email conversations, the need to leave sufficient time for consensus
to form, the hassle of dealing with naive newcomers who think they
understand all the issues but actually don't (every project has these;
sometimes they're next year's star contributors, sometimes they stay
naive forever), the person who can't understand why you only want to
solve problem X when it's obviously a subset of larger problem Y, and
so on.  The temptation to make decisions behind closed doors and
present them as <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">faits accomplis</em></span>, or at
least as the firm recommendations of a united and influential voting
block, will be great indeed.</p><p>Don't do it.</p><p>As slow and cumbersome as public discussion can be, it's
almost always preferable in the long run.  Making important decisions
in private is like spraying contributor repellant on your project.  No
serious contributor would stick around for long in an environment where
a secret council makes all the big decisions.  Furthermore, public
discussion has beneficial side effects that will last beyond whatever
ephemeral technical question was at issue:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion will help train and educate new developers.
        You never know how many eyes are watching the conversation;
        even if most people don't participate, many may be lurking
        silently, gleaning information about the software.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion will train <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> in the art
        of explaining technical issues to people who are not as
        familiar with the software as you are.  This is a skill that
        requires practice, and you can't get that practice by talking
        to people who already know what you know.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The discussion and its conclusions will be available in public
        archives forever after, enabling future discussions to avoid
        retracing the same steps.  See
        <a class="xref" href="growth.html#using-archives" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives">the section called &#8220;Conspicuous Use of Archives&#8221;</a>.</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>Finally, there is the possibility that someone on the list may
make a real contribution to the conversation, by coming up with an
idea you never anticipated.  It's hard to say how likely this is; it
just depends on the complexity of the code and degree of
specialization required.  But if anecdotal evidence may be permitted,
I would hazard that this is more likely than you might intuitively
expect.  In the Subversion project, we (the founders) believed we
faced a deep and complex set of problems, which we had been thinking
about hard for several months, and we frankly doubted that anyone on
the newly created mailing list was likely to make a real contribution
to the discussion.  So we took the lazy route and started batting some
technical ideas back and forth in private emails, until an observer of
the project<sup>[<a name="idp691" href="#ftn.idp691" class="footnote">22</a>]</sup> caught wind of what
was happening and asked for the discussion to be moved to the public
list.  Rolling our eyes a bit, we did &#8212; and were stunned by the
number of insightful comments and suggestions that quickly resulted.
In many cases people offered ideas that had never even occurred to us.
It turned out there were some <span class="emphasis"><em>very</em></span> smart people
on that list; they'd just been waiting for the right bait.  It's true
that the ensuing discussions took longer than they would have if we
had kept the conversation private, but they were so much more
productive that it was well worth the extra time.</p><p>Without descending into hand-waving generalizations like "the
group is always smarter than the individual" (we've all met enough
groups to know better), it must be acknowledged that there are certain
activities at which groups excel.  Massive peer review is one of them;
generating large numbers of ideas quickly is another.  The quality of
the ideas depends on the quality of the thinking that went into them,
of course, but you won't know what kinds of thinkers are out there
until you stimulate them with a challenging problem.</p><p>Naturally, there are some discussions that must be had
privately; throughout this book we'll see examples of those.  But the
guiding principle should always be: <span class="emphasis"><em>If there's no reason for
it to be private, it should be public.</em></span></p><p>Making this happen requires action.  It's not enough merely to
ensure that all your own posts go to the public list.  You also have
to nudge other people's unnecessarily private conversations to the
list too.  If someone tries to start a private discussion with you and
there's no reason for it to be private, then it is incumbent on you to open
the appropriate meta-discussion immediately.  Don't even comment on
the original topic until you've either successfully steered the
conversation to a public place, or ascertained that privacy really was
needed.  If you do this consistently, people will catch on pretty
quickly and start to use the public forums by default.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Nip Rudeness in the Bud"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="prevent-rudeness"></a>Nip Rudeness in the Bud</h3></div></div></div><p>From the very start of your project's public existence, you
should maintain a zero-tolerance policy toward rude or insulting
behavior in its forums.  Zero-tolerance does not mean technical
enforcement per se.  You don't have to remove people from the mailing
list when they flame another subscriber, or take away their commit
access because they made derogatory comments.  (In theory, you might
eventually have to resort to such actions, but only after all other
avenues have failed &#8212; which, by definition, isn't the case at the
start of the project.)  Zero-tolerance simply means never letting bad
behavior slide by unnoticed.  For example, when someone posts a
technical comment mixed together with an <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hominem</em></span> attack on some other developer in the project,
it is imperative that your response address the <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hominem</em></span> attack as a separate issue unto itself,
separate from the technical content.</p><p>It is unfortunately very easy, and all too typical, for
constructive discussions to lapse into destructive flame wars.
People will say things in email that they would never say
face-to-face.  The topics of discussion only amplify this effect: in
technical issues, people often feel there is a single right answer to
most questions, and that disagreement with that answer can only be
explained by ignorance or stupidity.  It's a short distance from
calling someone's technical proposal stupid to calling the person
themselves stupid.  In fact, it's often hard to tell where technical
debate leaves off and character attack begins, which is one reason why
drastic responses or punishments are not a good idea.  Instead, when
you think you see it happening, make a post that stresses the
importance of keeping the discussion friendly, without accusing anyone
of being deliberately poisonous.  Such "Nice Police" posts do have an
unfortunate tendency to sound like a kindergarten teacher lecturing a
class on good behavior:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>First, let's please cut down on the
      (potentially) ad hominem comments; for example, calling J's
      design for the security layer "naive and ignorant of the basic
      principles of computer security."  That may be true or it may
      not, but in either case it's no way to have the discussion.  J
      made his proposal in good faith.  If it has deficiencies, point
      them out, and we'll fix them or get a new design.  I'm sure M
      meant no personal insult to J, but the phrasing was unfortunate,
      and we try to keep things constructive around here.
      </em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Now, on to the proposal.  I think M was right
      in saying that...</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>As stilted as such responses sound, they have a noticeable
effect.  If you consistently call out bad behavior, but don't demand
an apology or acknowledgement from the offending party, then you leave
people free to cool down and show their better side by behaving more
decorously next time &#8212; and they will.</p><p>One of the secrets of
doing this successfully is to never make the meta-discussion the main
topic.  It should always be an aside, a brief preface to the main
portion of your response.  Point out in passing that "we don't do
things that way around here," but then move on to the real content, so
that you're giving people something on-topic to respond to.  If
someone protests that they didn't deserve your rebuke, simply refuse
to be drawn into an argument about it.  Either don't respond (if you
think they're just letting off steam and don't require a response), or
say you're sorry if you overreacted and that it's hard to detect
nuance in email, then get back to the main topic.  Never, ever insist
on an acknowledgement, whether public or private, from someone that
they behaved inappropriately.  If they choose of their own volition to
post an apology, that's great, but demanding that they do so will only
cause resentment.</p><p>The overall goal is to make good etiquette be seen as one of the
"in-group" behaviors.  This helps the project, because developers can
be driven away (even from projects they like and want to support) by
flame wars.  You may not even know that they were driven away; someone
might lurk on the mailing list, see that it takes a thick skin to
participate in the project, and decide against getting involved at
all.  Keeping forums friendly is a long-term survival strategy, and
it's easier to do when the project is still small.  Once it's part of
the culture, you won't have to be the only person promoting it.  It
will be maintained by everyone.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Codes of Conduct"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="code-of-conduct"></a>Codes of Conduct</h3></div></div></div><p>In the decade since the first edition of this book in 2006, it
has become somewhat more common for open source projects, especially
the larger ones, to adopt an explicit <em class="firstterm">code of
conduct</em>.  I think this is a good trend.  As open source
projects become, at long last, more diverse, the presence of a code of
conduct can remind participants to think twice about whether a joke is
going to be hurtful to some people, or whether &#8212; to
pick a random example &#8212; it contributes to a welcoming
and inclusive atmosphere when an open source image processing
library's documentation just happens to use yet another picture of a
pretty young woman to illustrate the behavior of a particular
algorithm.  Codes of conduct remind participants that the maintenance
of a respectful and welcoming environment is everyone's
responsibility.</p><p>An Internet search will easily find many examples of codes of
conduct for open source projects.  The most popular one is probably
the one at <a class="ulink" href="https://contributor-covenant.org/" target="_top">https://contributor-covenant.org/</a>, so naturally there's a positive
feedback dynamic if you choose that one: more developers will be
already familiar with it, plus you get its translations into other
languages for free, etc.</p><p>A code of conduct will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> solve all the
interpersonal problems in your project.  Furthermore, if it is
misused, it has the potential to create new
problems &#8212; it's always possible to find people who
specialize in manipulating social norms and rules to harm a community
rather than help it (see <a class="xref" href="difficult-people.html" title="Difficult People">the section called &#8220;Difficult People&#8221;</a>), and
if you're particularly unlucky some of those people may find their way
into your project.  It is always up to the project leadership, by
which I mean those whom others in the project tend to listen to the
most, to enforce a code of conduct, and to see to it that a code of
conduct is used wisely.  (See also <a class="xref" href="you-are-what-you-write.html#rudeness" title="Recognizing Rudeness">the section called &#8220;Recognizing Rudeness&#8221;</a>.)</p><p>Some participants may genuinely disagree with the need to adopt
a code at all, and argue against it on the grounds that it could do
more harm than good.  Even if you feel they're wrong, it is imperative
that you help make sure they're able to state their view without being
attacked for it.  After all, disagreeing with the need for a code of
conduct is not the same as &#8212; is, in fact, entirely
unrelated to &#8212;  engaging in behavior that would be a
violation of the proposed code of conduct.  Sometimes people confuse
these two things, and need to be reminded of the
distinction.<sup>[<a name="idp723" href="#ftn.idp723" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="sect2" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="code-review"></a>Practice Conspicuous Code Review</h3></div></div></div><p>One of the best ways to foster a productive development
community is to get people looking at each others'
code &#8212; ideally, to get them looking at each others'
code <span class="emphasis"><em>changes</em></span> as those changes arrive.
<em class="firstterm">Commit review</em> (sometimes just called
<em class="firstterm">code review</em>) is the practice of reviewing
commits as they come in, looking for bugs and possible
improvements.</p><p>There are a couple of reasons to focus on reviewing changes,
rather than on reviewing code that's been around for a while.  First,
it just works better socially: when someone reviews your change, she
is interacting with work you did recently.  That means if she comments
on it right away, you will be maximally interested in hearing what she
has to say; six months later, you might not feel as motivated to
engage, and in any case might not remember the change very well.
Second, looking at what changes in a codebase is a gateway to looking
at the rest of the code anyway &#8212; reviewing a change
often causes one to look at the surrounding code, at the affected
callers and callees elsewhere, at related module interfaces,
etc.<sup>[<a name="idp733" href="#ftn.idp733" class="footnote">24</a>]</sup></p><p>Commit review thus serves several purposes simultaneously.  It's
the most obvious example of peer review in the open source world, and
directly helps to maintain software quality.  Every bug that ships in
a piece of software got there by being committed and not detected;
therefore, the more eyes watch commits, the fewer bugs will ship.  But
commit review also serves an indirect purpose: it confirms to people
that what they do matters, because one obviously wouldn't take time to
review a commit unless one cared about its effect.  People do their
best work when they know that others will take the time to evaluate
it.</p><p>Reviews should be public.  Even on occasions when I have been
sitting in the same physical room with another developer, and one of
us has made a commit, we take care not to do the review verbally in
the room, but to send it to the appropriate online review forum
instead.  Everyone benefits from seeing the review happen.  People
follow the commentary and sometimes find flaws in it; even when they
don't, it still reminds them that review is an expected, regular
activity, like washing the dishes or mowing the lawn.</p><p>Some technical infrastructure is required to do change-by-change
review effectively.  In particular, setting up commit notifications is
extremely useful.  The effect of commit notifications is that every
time someone commits a change to the central repository, an email or
other subscribable notification goes out showing the log message and
diffs (unless the diff is too large; see <a class="xref" href="vc.html#vc-vocabulary-diff"><em class="firstterm">diff</em></a>, in <a class="xref" href="vc.html#vc-vocabulary" title="Version Control Vocabulary">the section called &#8220;Version Control Vocabulary&#8221;</a>).
The review itself might take place on a mailing list, or in a review
tool such as Gerrit or the GitHub "pull request" interface.  See <a class="xref" href="vc.html#commit-notifications" title="Commit Notifications / Commit Emails">the section called &#8220;Commit Notifications / Commit Emails&#8221;</a> for details.</p><div class="sect3" title="Case study"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="subversion-commit-review"></a>Case study</h4></div></div></div><p>In the Subversion project, we did not at first make a regular
practice of code review.  There was no guarantee that every commit
would be reviewed, though one might sometimes look over a change if
one were particularly interested in that area of the code.  Bugs
slipped in that really could and should have been caught.  A developer
named Greg Stein, who knew the value of code review from past work,
decided that he was going to set an example by reviewing every line of
<span class="emphasis"><em>every single commit</em></span> that went into the code
repository.  Each commit anyone made was soon followed by an email to
the developer's list from Greg, dissecting the commit, analyzing
possible problems, and occasionally praising a clever bit of code.  Right
away, he was catching bugs and non-optimal coding practices that would
otherwise have slipped by without ever being noticed.  Pointedly, he
never complained about being the only person reviewing every commit,
even though it took a fair amount of his time, but he did sing the
praises of code review whenever he had the chance.  Pretty soon, other
people, myself included, started reviewing commits regularly too.</p><p>What was our motivation?  It wasn't that Greg had consciously shamed
us into it.  But he had proven that reviewing code was a valuable way
to spend time, and that one could contribute as much to the project by
reviewing others' changes as by writing new code.  Once he
demonstrated that, it became expected behavior, to the point where any
commit that didn't get some reaction would cause the committer to
worry, and even ask on the list whether anyone had had a chance to
review it yet.  Later, Greg got a job that didn't leave him as much
time for Subversion, and had to stop doing regular reviews.  But by
then, the habit was so ingrained for the rest of us as to seem that it
had been going on since time immemorial.</p></div><p>Start doing reviews from the very first commit.  The sorts of
problems that are easiest to catch by reviewing diffs are security
vulnerabilities, memory leaks, insufficient comments or API
documentation, off-by-one errors, caller/callee discipline mismatches,
and other problems that require a minimum of surrounding context to
spot.  However, even larger-scale issues such as failure to abstract
repeated patterns to a single location become spottable after one has
been doing reviews regularly, because the memory of past diffs informs
the review of present diffs.</p><p>Don't worry that you might not find anything to comment on, or
that you don't know enough about every area of the code.  There will
usually be something to say about almost every commit; even where you
don't find anything to question, you may find something to praise.
The important thing is to make it clear to every committer that what
they do is seen and understood, that attention is being paid.  Of
course, code review does not absolve programmers of the responsibility
to review and test their changes before committing; no one should
depend on code review to catch things she ought to have caught on her
own.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Be Open From Day One"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="be-open-from-day-one"></a>Be Open From Day One</h3></div></div></div><p>Start your project out in the open from the very first day.  The
longer a project is run in a closed source manner, the harder it is to
open source later.<sup>[<a name="idp751" href="#ftn.idp751" class="footnote">25</a>]</sup></p><p>Being open source from the start doesn't mean your developers
must immediately take on the extra responsibilities of community
management.  People often think that "open source" means "strangers
distracting us with questions", but that's
optional &#8212; it's something you might do down the road,
if and when it makes sense for your project.  It's under your control.
There are still major advantages to be had by running the project out
in open, publicly-visible forums from the beginning.  Conversely, the
longer the project is run closed-source, the more difficult it will be
to open up later.</p><p>I think there's one underlying cause for this:</p><p>At each step in a project, programmers face a choice: to do that
step in a manner compatible with a hypothetical future open-sourcing,
or do it in a manner incompatible with open-sourcing.  And every time
they choose the latter, the project gets just a little bit harder to
open source.</p><p>The crucial thing is, they can't help choosing the latter
occasionally &#8212; all the pressures of development propel
them that way.  It's very difficult to give a future event the same
present-day weight as, say, fixing the incoming bugs reported by the
testers, or finishing that feature the customer just added to the
spec.  Also, programmers struggling to stay on budget will inevitably
cut corners here and there.  In Ward Cunningham's phrase, they will
incur "technical debt" (<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt</a>), with the
intention of paying back that debt later.</p><p>Thus, when it's time to open source, you'll suddenly find there
are things like:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Customer-specific configurations and passwords checked
            into the code repository;</li><li class="listitem">Sample data constructed from live (and confidential)

extra decision-making they sometimes require.  For example, if
sensitive material was checked into the code repository in the past,
your team now faces a choice between cleaning it out of the historical
revisions entirely, so you can open source the entire (sanitized)
history, or just cleaning up the latest revision and open-sourcing
from that (sometimes called a "top-skim").  Neither method is wrong or
right &#8212; and that's the problem: now you've got one
more discussion to have and one more decision to make.  In some
projects, that decision gets made and reversed several times before
the final release. The thrashing itself is part of the cost.</p><div class="sect3" title="Waiting Just Creates an Exposure Event"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="avoid-exposure-events"></a>Waiting Just Creates an Exposure Event</h4></div></div></div><p>The other problem with opening up a developed codebase is that
it creates a needlessly large exposure event.  Whatever issues there
may be in the code (modularity corner-cutting, security
vulnerabilities, etc), they are all exposed to public scrutiny at
once &#8212; the open-sourcing event becomes an opportunity
for the technical blogosphere to pounce on the code and see what they
can find.</p><p>Contrast that with the scenario where development was done in
the open from the beginning: code changes come in one at a time, so
problems are handled as they come up (and are often caught sooner,
since there are more eyeballs on the code).  Because changes reach the
public at a low, continuous rate of exposure, no one blames your
development team for the occasional corner-cutting or flawed code
checkin.  Everyone's been there, after all; these tradeoffs are
inevitable in real-world development.  As long as the technical debt
is properly recorded in "FIXME" comments and bug reports, and any
security issues are addressed promptly, it's fine.  Yet if those same
issues were to appear suddenly all at once, unsympathetic observers
may jump on the aggregate exposure in a way they never would have if
the issues had come up piecemeal in the normal course of
development.</p><p>(These concerns apply even more strongly to government software
projects; see <a class="xref" href="governments-and-open-source.html#starting-open-for-govs" title="Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects">the section called &#8220;Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for
Government Projects&#8221;</a>.)</p></div><p>The good news is that these are all unforced errors.  A project
incurs little extra cost by avoiding them in the simplest way
possible: by running in the open from Day One.</p><p>"In the open" means the following things are publicly
accessible, in standard formats, from the first day of the project:
the code repository, bug tracker, design documents, user
documentation, wiki, and developer discussion forums. It also means
the code and documentation are placed under an open source license, of
course. It also means your team's day-to-day work takes place in the
publicly visible area.</p><p>"In the open" does not have to mean: allowing strangers to check
code into your repository (they're free to copy it into their own
repository, if they want, and work with it there); allowing anyone to
file bug reports in your tracker (you're free to choose your own QA
process, and if allowing reports from strangers doesn't help you, you
don't have to do it); reading and responding to every bug report
filed, even if you do allow strangers to file; responding to every
question people ask in the forums (even if you moderate them through);
reviewing every patch or suggestion posted, when doing so may cost
valuable development time; etc.</p><p>One way to think of it is: you open source your code, not your
time.  The former resource is infinitely replicable; the latter is
not, and you may protect it however you need to.  You'll have to
determine the point at which engaging with outside users and
developers makes sense for your project.  In the long run it usually
does, and most of this book is about how to do it effectively.  But
the pace of engagement is always under your control.  Developing in
the open does not change this, it just ensures that everything done in
the project is, by definition, done in a way that's compatible with
being open source.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp691" href="#idp691" class="para">22</a>] </sup>We haven't gotten to the section on
crediting yet, but just to practice what I'll later preach: the

the general importance of keeping all discussions public unless there
was a specific need for privacy.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp723" href="#idp723" class="para">23</a>] </sup>There's an excellent post entitled <a class="ulink" href="https://subfictional.com/2016/01/25/the-complex-reality-of-adopting-a-meaningful-code-of-conduct/" target="_top">https://subfictional.com/2016/01/25/the-complex-reality-of-adopting-a-meaningful-code-of-conduct/</a>

code review, of course, for example to do a security audit.  But while
that kind of review is important too, it's more of a generic
development best practice, and is not as specifically relevant to
running an open source project as change-by-change review
is.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp751" href="#idp751" class="para">25</a>] </sup>This section started out as a blog
