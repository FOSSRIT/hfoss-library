free software projects over the last decade or so.  It is still the
case that the most important things about your project are its the
quality of its code, its features, and the health of its developer
community.  However, although all open source licenses share the same
basic guarantees of freedom, their terms are not exactly the same in
all details.  The particular license your project uses can affect
which entities decide to get involved in it and how.  You will
therefore need a basic understanding of free software licensing, both
to ensure that the project's license is compatible with its goals, and
to be able to discuss licensing decisions with others.</p><p>Please note that I am not a lawyer, and that nothing in this

becomes apparent is that there seem to be many different words for the
same thing: <em class="firstterm">free software</em>,
<em class="firstterm">open source</em>,
<em class="firstterm">FOSS</em>, <em class="firstterm">F/OSS</em>, and
<em class="firstterm">FLOSS</em>.  Let's start by sorting those
out, along with a few other terms.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">free software</em></span></dt><dd><p>Software that can be freely shared and modified,
              including in source code form.  The term was first
              coined by Richard Stallman, who codified it in the GNU
              General Public License (GPL), and who founded the Free
              Software Foundation (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.fsf.org/" target="_top">https://www.fsf.org/</a>) to promote the concept.</p><p>Although "free software" covers the
              same set of software as "open source", the FSF, among
              others, prefers the former term because it emphasizes
              the idea of freedom, and the concept of
              freely redistributable software as primarily a social
              movement rather than a technical one.  The FSF
              acknowledges that the term is ambiguous &#8212; it could
              mean "free" as in "zero-cost", instead of "free" as in
              "freedom" &#8212; but feels that it's still the best term,
              all things considered, and that the other possibilities
              in English have their own ambiguities.  (Throughout this
              book, "free" is used in the "freedom" sense, not the
              "zero-cost" sense.)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">open source software</em></span></dt><dd><p>Free software under another name.  The
              different name is sometimes used to indicate a philosophical
              difference, however.  In fact, the term "open source"
              was coined by the group that founded the Open Source 
              Initiative (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.opensource.org/" target="_top">https://www.opensource.org/</a>)
              as a deliberate alternative to "free software".  Their
              goal at the time was largely to make such software a
              more palatable choice for
              corporations, by presenting it as a development
              methodology rather than as a political
              movement.<sup>[<a name="idp3774" href="#ftn.idp3774" class="footnote">96</a>]</sup></p><p>While any license that is free is also open
              source, and vice versa (with a few minor exceptions that
              have no practical consequences),
              people tend to pick one term and stick with it.  In
              general, those who prefer "free software" are more
              likely to have a philosophical or moral stance on the
              issue, while those who prefer "open source" either don't
              view it as a matter of freedom, or are not interested in
              advertising the fact that they do.  See
              <a class="xref" href="introduction.html#free-vs-open-source" title='"Free" Versus "Open Source"'>the section called &#8220;"Free" Versus "Open Source"&#8221;</a> for a more
              detailed history of this terminological schism.</p><p>The Free Software Foundation has an
              excellent &#8212; utterly unobjective, but nuanced and
              quite fair &#8212; exegesis of the two terms, at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-software-for-freedom.html" target="_top">https://www.fsf.org/licensing/essays/free-software-for-freedom.html</a>.
              The Open Source Initiative's take on it is (or was, in
              2002) spread across two pages: <a class="ulink" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021204155022/http://www.opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_hackers.php#marketing" target="_top">https://web.archive.org/web/20021204155022/http://www.opensource.org/advocacy/case_for_hackers.php#marketing</a>

              be three, and that is exactly what is happening with
              terms for free software.  Many people have started
              using "FOSS" (or, more rarely, "F/OSS"), standing
              for "Free / Open Source Software".  Another variant
              gaining momentum is "FLOSS", which
              stands for "Free / Libre Open Source Software"
              (<span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">libre</em></span> is familiar from
              many Romance languages and does not suffer from the ambiguities
              of "free"; see
              <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS</a> for more).</p><p>All these terms mean the same thing:
              software that can be modified and redistributed by
              everyone, sometimes &#8212; but not always &#8212; with the
              requirement that derivative works be freely
              redistributable under the same terms.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">DFSG-compliant</em></span></dt><dd><p>Compliant with the Debian Free Software Guidelines
              (<a class="ulink" href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines" target="_top">https://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines</a>).
              This is a widely-used test for whether a given license
              is truly open source
              (free, <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">libre</em></span>, etc.).  The
              Debian Project's mission is to maintain an entirely free
              operating system, such that someone installing it need
              never doubt that she has the right to modify and
              redistribute any or all of the system.  The Debian Free
              Software Guidelines are the requirements that a software
              package's license must meet in order to be included in
              Debian.  Because the Debian Project spent a good deal of
              time thinking about how to construct such a test, the
              guidelines they came up with have proven very robust
              (see <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFSG</a>),
              and as far as I'm aware, no serious objection to them has
              been raised either by the Free Software Foundation or
              the Open Source Initiative.  If you know that a given
              license is DFSG-compliant, you know that it guarantees
              all the important freedoms (such as forkability even
              against the original author's wishes) required to
              sustain the dynamics of an open source project.  Since
              2004, the Debian Project has maintained a list of known
              DFSG-compliant licenses at <a class="ulink" href="https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses" target="_top">https://wiki.debian.org/DFSGLicenses</a>.  All of the licenses
              discussed in this chapter are DFSG-compliant.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">OSI-approved</em></span></dt><dd><p>Approved by the Open Source Initiative.  This is
              another widely-used test of whether a license permits
              all the necessary freedoms.  The OSI's definition of
              open source software is based on the Debian Free
              Software Guidelines, and any license that meets one
              definition almost always meets the other.  There have
              been a few exceptions over the years, but only involving
              niche licenses and none of any relevance here.  The OSI
              maintains a list of all
              licenses it has ever approved, at
              <a class="ulink" href="https://www.opensource.org/licenses/" target="_top">https://www.opensource.org/licenses/</a>, so
              that being "OSI-approved" is an unambiguous state: a
              license either is or isn't on the list.</p><p>The Free Software Foundation also maintains a list
              of licenses at <a class="ulink" href="https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/license-list.html" target="_top">https://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/license-list.html</a>.
              The FSF categorizes licenses not only by whether they
              are free, but whether they are compatible with the GNU
              General Public License.  GPL compatibility is an
              important topic, covered in
              <a class="xref" href="license-compatibility.html" title="The GPL and License Compatibility">the section called &#8220;The GPL and License Compatibility&#8221;</a>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">proprietary</em>,
                      <em class="firstterm">closed-source</em></span></dt><dd><p>The opposite of "free" or "open source."  It means
              software distributed under traditional, royalty-based
              licensing terms, where users pay per copy, or under any
              other terms sufficiently restrictive to prevent open
              source dynamics from operating.  Even software
              distributed at no charge can still be proprietary, if
              its license does not permit free redistribution and
              modification.</p><p>Generally "proprietary" and "closed-source" are
              synonyms.  However, "closed-source" additionally implies
              that the source code cannot even be seen.  Since the
              source code cannot be seen with most proprietary
              software, this is normally a distinction without a
              difference.  However, occasionally someone releases
              proprietary software under a license that allows others
              to view the source code.  Confusingly, they sometimes
              call this "open source" or "nearly open source," etc.,
              but that's misleading. The
              <span class="emphasis"><em>visibility</em></span> of the source code is
              not the issue; the important question is what you're
              allowed to do with it: if you can't copy, modify, and
              redistribute, then it's not open source.  Thus, the
              difference between proprietary and closed-source is
              mostly irrelevant; generally, the two can be treated
              as synonyms.</p><p>Sometimes <em class="firstterm">commercial</em> is
              used as a synonym for "proprietary," but this is
              carelessness: the two are not the same.  Free software
              is always commercial software.  After all, free software
              can be sold, as long as the buyers are not restricted
              from giving away copies themselves.  It can be
              commercialized in other ways as well, for example by
              selling support, services, and certification.  There are
              billion-dollar companies built on free software
              today, so it is clearly neither inherently
              anti-commercial nor anti-corporate.  It is merely
              anti-proprietary, or if you prefer anti-monopoly,
              and this is the key way in which it differs from
              per-copy license models.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">public domain</em></span></dt><dd><p>Having no copyright holder, meaning that there is
              no one who has the right to restrict copying of the
              work.  Being in the public domain is not the same as
              having no author.  Everything has an author, and even if a
              work's author or authors choose to put it in the public
              domain, that doesn't change the fact that they wrote
              it.</p><p>When a work is in the public domain, material from
              it can be incorporated into a copyrighted work, and the
              derivative is thus under the same overall copyright as
              the original copyrighted work.  But this does not affect
              the availability of the original public domain wok.
              Thus, releasing something into the public domain is
              technically one way to make it "free," according to the
              guidelines of most free software certifying
              organizations (see <a class="ulink" href="https://opensource.org/faq#public-domain" target="_top">https://opensource.org/faq#public-domain</a> for more).
              However, there are usually good reasons to use a license
              instead of just releasing into the public domain: even
              with free software, certain terms and conditions can be
              useful, not only to the copyright holder but to
              recipients as well, as the next section makes clear.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><em class="firstterm">copyleft</em></span></dt><dd><p>A license that not only grants the freedoms under

              freedoms apply to any derivative works.</p><p>The canonical example of a copyleft license is
              still the GNU General Public License, which stipulates

              works as well.</p><p>Two early and well-known examples of permissive
