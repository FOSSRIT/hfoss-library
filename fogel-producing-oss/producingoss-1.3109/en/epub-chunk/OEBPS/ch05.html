capacity constructively in a free software environment.  It also
discusses some of the adjustments your organization may need to
make as it gets involved in free software projects.  When an
organization makes an investment in open source, people at all levels
have to understand not just how best to structure that investment, but
the effects that long-term open source engagement will have on the
organization itself.  Open source can be
transformative — at least when done right.  Thus,
while the material here should be useful for developers who are paid
to work on open source projects, it's really meant for their managers
and for executives making strategic decisions.</p><p>This chapter is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> primarily about how to
find funding sources for your open source project, though I hope it
will usefully inform that topic.  There are many different ways open
source projects are funded<sup>[<a id="idm1973" href="#ftn.idm1973" class="footnote">49</a>]</sup>, just as there are many ways
all human endeavors are funded.  While open source is incompatible
with one particular business
model — monopoly-controlled royalty streams based on
per-copy sales — it is compatible with all the others,
and indeed is better suited to some of them than proprietary software
is.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="The Economics of Open Source"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="economics-of-open-source"/>The Economics of Open Source</h1></div></div></div><p>People are still sometimes surprised to learn that most free
software is written by paid developers, not by volunteers.  But the
economics that drive open source are actually quite straightforward: a
company often needs a particular piece of software to be maintained
and developed, and yet does not need a monopoly on that software.
Indeed, it would often be disadvantageous to have a monopoly, because
then the entire burden of maintenance would fall on that one company,
instead of being shared with others who have the same needs.  For
example, most companies have web sites and therefore need a web
server, but almost no companies need exclusive control over the
development of their web server, or intend to sell copies of it on a
proprietary basis.  The same is true of office software suites,
operating system kernels, network connectivity tools, educational
programs, etc — just as historically it has been true
of electric grids, roads, sewer systems, and other goods that everyone
needs but no one needs to own.  Just as we expect road workers to be
paid, we should expect software developers to be paid as well.</p><p>Even in the early days of free software, when the proportion of
truly unpaid volunteers was probably higher than it is now, there were
already developers who were paid for their work.  There was also a lot
of informal subsidy, as there continues to be today.  When a system
administrator writes a network analysis tool to help her do her job,
then posts it online and gets bug fixes and feature contributions from
other system administrators, what's happened is that an unofficial
consortium has been formed.  The consortium's funding comes from the
sysadmins' salaries; its office space and network bandwidth are
donated, albeit unknowingly, by the organizations those people work
for.  Those organizations also benefit from the investment, of course,
although they may or may not be institutionally aware of it.</p><p>Today such efforts are often more
formalized.  Corporations have become conscious of the benefits of
open source software, and now involve themselves intentionally in its
development.  Developers too have come to expect that really important
projects will attract funding in one way or another.  The key question
is how the hierarchical command structures of corporations and the
semi-decentralized, non-coercive communities of free software projects
can work productively with each other, and how they can more or
less agree on what "productively" means.</p><p>Financial backing is generally welcomed by open source
development communities.  Having paid developers mean that bug reports
are more likely to be listened to, that needed work is more likely to
get done, and that the project will be less vulnerable to the Forces
of Chaos (e.g., a key developer suddenly losing interest) lurking
at the edges of every collaborative endeavor.  One important dynamic
is that credibility is contagious, to a point.  When, for example,
Google backs an open source project, people assume the project will
have the chance to succeed or fail on its long-term merits, while
receiving adequate support in its early stages; other participants'
resultant willingness to devote effort to it can then make this a
self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>However, funding can also bring a perception of control.  If not
handled carefully, money can divide a project into in-group and
out-group developers.  If developers who aren't officially paid to
work on the project get the feeling that design decisions or feature
additions are simply available to the highest bidder, they'll head off
to a project that seems more like a meritocracy and less like unpaid
labor for someone else's benefit.  They may never complain overtly on
the mailing lists.  Instead, there will simply be less and less noise
from external sources, as the "out" developers gradually stop trying
to be taken seriously.  The buzz of small-scale activity will
continue, in the form of bug reports and occasional small fixes.  But
there will be fewer and fewer large code contributions from unexpected
sources, fewer unexpected opinions voiced in design discussions, and
so on.  People sense what's expected of them, and live up (or down) to
those expectations.</p><p>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
can't buy influence.  It most certainly can.  The trick is that it
doesn't buy influence directly.  Instead, it buys
development credibility, which is convertible to influence through the
project's decision-making processes.  In a straightforward commercial
transaction, you trade money for what you want.  If you need a feature
added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and (if all goes well) the
work gets done and the feature eventually lands in the product.  In an
open source project, it's not so simple.  You may sign a contract with
some developers, but they'd be fooling themselves — and
you — if they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be
accepted by the development community simply because you paid for it.
The work can only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits
into the community's vision for the software (see <a class="xref" href="ch05s08.html" title="Contracting">the section called “Contracting”</a> and <a class="xref" href="ch05s12.html" title="Hiring Open Source Developers">the section called “Hiring Open Source Developers”</a>). You may have
some say in that vision, but you won't be the only voice.</p><p>So money can't purchase influence directly, but it can purchase things
that <span class="emphasis"><em>lead to</em></span> influence.  The most obvious example
is programmers.  If you hire good programmers, and they stick around
long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
any other member.  They will have a vote, or if there are many of
them, they will have a voting block<sup>[<a id="idm1988" href="#ftn.idm1988" class="footnote">50</a>]</sup>.  If they are respected in the
project, they will have influence beyond just their votes.  There is
no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either.  After
all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
reason.  Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
else's.  It's just that the weight given to your company's goals will
be determined by its representatives' status in the project, not by
your company's size, budget, or business plan.<sup>[<a id="idm1992" href="#ftn.idm1992" class="footnote">51</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm1973" href="#idm1973" class="para">49</a>] </sup>See <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software</a>
for an incomplete list.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm1988" href="#idm1988" class="para">50</a>] </sup>Even though actual
votes may be rare, as noted in <a class="xref" href="ch04s03.html" title="Consensus-based Democracy">the section called “Consensus-based Democracy”</a>,
the <span class="emphasis"><em>possibility</em></span> of a vote has great implicit
power, so membership in the electorate is still important even if no
vote is ever held.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm1992" href="#idm1992" class="para">51</a>] </sup>When
companies need to guarantee that certain features and bug fixes land
in a specified amount of time, they accomplish this by keeping their
own copy (which may be partially or wholly public) of the project, and
merging it from time to time with a separate public copy that has its
own governance.  Google's Android operating system is a classic
example: Google maintains its own copy of Android, which it governs as it
pleases, and from time to time merges changes between that copy and
the Android Open Source Project (<a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Open-source_community">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Open-source_community</a>).  Essentially, Google is on a
very long copy-modify-merge loop with respect to the open source
project, and vice versa.  It is in neither side's interests to
permanently diverge from the other.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
