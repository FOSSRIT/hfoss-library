possible use an existing license instead of making up a new one.
There are two reasons why existing licenses are better:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Familiarity.  If you use one of the three or four
            most popular licenses, people won't feel they have to read
            the legalese in order to use your code, because they'll
            have already done so for that license a long time ago.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Quality.  Unless you have a team of lawyers at your
            disposal, you are unlikely to come up with a legally solid
            license.  The licenses mentioned here are the products of
            much thought and experience; unless your project has truly
            unusual needs, it is unlikely you would do better.</p></li></ul></div><p>To apply one of these licenses to your project, see

possible number of developers and derivative works, and you do not
mind the code being used in proprietary programs, choose the MIT / X
Window System license (so named because it is the license under which
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology released the original X
Window System code).  This license's basic message is "You are free to
use this code however you want."  It is compatible with the GNU GPL,
and it is short, simple, and easy to understand:</p><pre class="screen">Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt; &lt;copyright holders&gt;

proprietary programs, or if you at least don't care whether or not it
can be used in proprietary programs, choose the GNU General Public
License
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html">http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html</a>).  The
GPL is probably the most widely-used free software license in the
world today; this instant recognizability is itself one of the GPL's
major advantages.</p><p>When writing a code library that is meant mainly to be used as
part of other programs, consider carefully whether the restrictions
imposed by the GPL are in line with your project's goals.  In some
cases—for example, when you're trying to unseat a competing,
proprietary library that does the same thing—it may make more
strategic sense to license your code in such a way that it can be
mixed into proprietary programs, even though you would otherwise not
wish this.  The Free Software Foundation even fashioned an alternative
to the GPL for such circumstances: the <em class="firstterm">GNU Library
GPL</em>, later renamed to the <em class="firstterm">GNU Lesser
GPL</em> (most people just use the acronym
<em class="firstterm">LGPL</em>, in any case).  The LGPL has looser
restrictions than the GPL, and can be mixed more easily with non-free
code.  However, it's also a bit complex and takes some time to
understand, so if you're not going to use the GPL, I recommend just
using the MIT/X-style license.</p><div class="sect3" title="Is the GPL free or not free?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="is-the-gpl-free"/>Is the GPL free or not free?</h3></div></div></div><p>One consequence of choosing the GPL is the
possibility—small, but not infinitely small—of finding
yourself or your project embroiled in a dispute about whether or not
the GPL is truly "free", given that it places some restrictions on
what you can do with the code—namely, the restriction that the
code cannot be distributed under any other license.  For some people,
the existence of this restriction means the GPL is "less free" than
more permissive licenses such as the MIT/X license.  Where this
argument usually goes, of course, is that since "more free" must be
better than "less free" (after all, who's not in favor of freedom?),
it follows that those licenses are better than the GPL.</p><p>This debate is another popular holy war (see
<a class="xref" href="ch06s02.html#holy-wars" title="Avoid Holy Wars">القسم المسمى “Avoid Holy Wars”</a><span> in
<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="فصل 6. تقنيات التواصل">فصل 6, <em>تقنيات التواصل</em></a></span>).  Avoid participating
in it, at least in project forums.  Don't attempt to prove that the
GPL is less free, as free, or more free than other licenses.  Instead,
emphasize the specific reasons your project chose the GPL.  If the
recognizability of license was a reason, say that.  If the enforcement
of a free license on derivative works was also a reason, say that too,
but refuse to be drawn into discussion about whether this makes the
code more or less "free".  Freedom is a complex topic, and there is
little point talking about it if terminology is going to be used as a
stalking horse for substance.</p><p>Since this is a book and not a mailing list thread, however, I
will admit that I've never understood the "GPL is not free" argument.
The only restriction the GPL imposes is that it prevents people from
imposing <span class="emphasis"><em>further</em></span> restrictions.  To say that this
results in less freedom has always seemed to me like saying that
outlawing slavery reduces freedom, because it prevents some people
from owning slaves.</p><p>(Oh, and if you do get drawn into a debate about it, don't raise
the stakes by making inflammatory analogies.)</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="What About The BSD License?"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="license-bsd"/>What About The BSD License?</h2></div></div></div><p>A fair amount of open source software is distributed under
a <em class="firstterm">BSD license</em> (or sometimes
a <em class="firstterm">BSD-style license</em>).  The original BSD license
was used for the Berkeley Software Distribution, in which the
University of California released important portions of a Unix
implementation.  This license (the exact text may be seen in section
2.2.2 of
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#6">http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#6</a>) was
similar in spirit to the MIT/X license, except for one
clause:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>All advertising materials mentioning features or use
of this software must display the following acknowledgement: This
product includes software developed by the University of California,
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>The presence of that clause not only made the original BSD
license GPL-incompatible, it also set a dangerous precedent: as other
organizations put similar advertising clauses into
<span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> free software—substituting their own
organization's name in place of "the University of California,
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory"—software redistributors faced an
ever-increasing burden in what they were required to display.
Fortunately, many of the projects that used this license became aware
of the problem, and simply dropped the advertising clause.  In 1999,
even the University of California did so.</p><p>The result is the revised BSD license, which is simply the
original BSD license with the advertising clause removed.  However,
this history makes the phrase "BSD license" a bit ambiguous: does it
refer to the original, or the revised version?  This is why I prefer
the MIT/X license, which is essentially equivalent, and which does not
suffer from any ambiguity.  However, there is perhaps one reason to
prefer the revised BSD license to the MIT/X license, which is that the
BSD includes this clause:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Neither the name of the &lt;ORGANIZATION&gt; nor the
names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products
derived from this software without specific prior written
permission.</em></span></p></blockquote></div><p>It's not clear that without such a clause, a recipient of the
software would have had the right to use the licensor's name anyway,
but the clause removes any possible doubt.  For organizations worried
about trademark control, therefore, the revised BSD license may be
slightly preferable to MIT/X.  In general, however, a liberal
copyright license does not imply that recipients have any right to use
or dilute your trademarks — copyright law and trademark law are
two different beasts.</p><p>If you wish to use the revised BSD license, a template is
available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php">http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>
