projects typically make only limited use of what most people think of
as "social networking" services.  But this seeming omission is really
a matter of definition: most of the infrastructure that open source
projects have been using for decades, since long before "social
networking" became a recognized category of software, is actually
social networking software even if it isn't called that.  The reason
open source projects tend not to have much presence <span class="emphasis"><em>as
projects</em></span> on, say, Facebook is just that the services Facebook
offers are not well-tuned to what open source projects need.  On the
other hand, as you might expect, the infrastructure these projects
have been using and improving for many years <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
quite well-tuned to their needs.</p><p>Most projects do use Twitter and similar microblog services,
because sending out short quips and announcements that can be easily
forwarded and replied to is a good way for a project to have
conversations with its community; see LibreOffice's "@AskLibreOffice"
tweet stream at <a class="ulink" href="https://twitter.com/AskLibreOffice">https://twitter.com/AskLibreOffice</a> for an example of this.  Projects
also sometimes use services such as <a class="ulink" href="https://www.eventbrite.com">https://www.eventbrite.com</a> and <a class="ulink" href="https://www.Meetup.com/">https://www.Meetup.com/</a> to arrange in-person
meetings of users and developers.</p><p>But beyond lightweight services such as those, most free
software projects do not maintain a large presence on mainstream
social media platforms (though individual developers sometimes do, of
course, and they may discuss the project there).  The reward the
project gets in exchange for that investment of time and attention
appears not to be high enough to be worth the effort.</p></div></body></html>
