bounty-based development incentives together here, not because they
are the same thing, but because to the extent that they are
problematic as ways of funding free software development, their
problems are similar.</p><p><em class="firstterm">Crowdfunding</em> refers to many
funders &#8212; often mostly
individuals &#8212; coming together to fund a particular
piece of development.  Crowdfunding campaigns are usually either "all
or nothing", meaning that each funder pledges money toward a total
threshold and the pledges are collected only if the threshold is met,
or "keep it all", which is essentially traditional donation: funds go
immediately to the recipient whether or not a stated goal amount is
ever met.  <a class="ulink" href="https://goteo.org/" target="_top">https://goteo.org/</a> and
<a class="ulink" href="https://kickstarter.com/" target="_top">https://kickstarter.com/</a> are
probably the best-known examples of all-or-nothing crowdfunding
services, though there are many others (I like Goteo because their
platform is itself free software, and because it is meant specifically
for freely-licensed projects, whereas Kickstarter does not take a
position on restrictiveness of licensing).  There are also sites like
<a class="ulink" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" target="_top">https://www.indiegogo.com/</a> that
support both models<sup>[<a name="idp2460" href="#ftn.idp2460" class="footnote">64</a>]</sup></p><p><em class="firstterm">Bounties</em> are one-time rewards for
completing specific tasks, such as fixing a bug or implementing a new
feature.  Bounties are often offered directly by the interested
parties, since there is no need for a pledge-collecting system, but
the site <a class="ulink" href="https://www.bountysource.com/" target="_top">https://www.bountysource.com/</a> also serves as a clearinghouse for open
source development bounties.</p><p>While both crowdfunding and bounties have funded some open
source work, they have not been a major economic force compared to
salaried or contracted development.  This does not mean you shouldn't
consider them: depending on the problem you're trying to solve, and on
the shapes of solutions you're willing to accept, crowdfunding or
bounty funding might be a good answer.  The problem they share is that
they are structured around development as a <span class="emphasis"><em>one-time
event</em></span> rather than as an ongoing process.  This would be
problematic for any kind of software development, but is especially so
for open source development, which if anything is is optimized more
for low-intensity, long-term investment rather than for high-intensity
burst investment.  Both crowdfunding campaigns and bounty prizes are
more compatible with high-intensity, one-time bursts of activity, and
do not provide for ongoing maintenance or investment past the
completion of the campaign goal or prize condition.<sup>[<a name="idp2468" href="#ftn.idp2468" class="footnote">65</a>]</sup></p><p>A crowdfunding campaign can sometimes be a good way to get a
project launched, but generally is not a way to fund development after
the initial launch.  Successive crowdfunding campaigns for later
stages of development or for releases will inevitably tire out even a
willing and supportive audience.  There is a reason why long-running
charities, for example the public radio network in the United States,
seek to develop sustaining funders (euphemistically called "members"
even though they often have no governance role) to provide a
long-term, stable revenue stream, and then raise funds for specific
one-time efforts separately from that.</p><p>If you do launch a crowdfunding campaign, take a close look at
how other open source projects have run theirs.  There are a number of
useful techniques that can be learned from the successful ones.  For
example, most campaign sites have a mechanism for offering different
rewards to backers at different monetary levels.  You could offer a
mention in a <code class="filename">SUPPORTERS</code> file in the project, and
perhaps at higher levels a mention on a thank-you page on the
project's web site.  But more creatively &#8212; I first
heard this idea from Michael Bernstein, and used
it &#8212; you can offer to dedicate a commit to each backer
at or above a certain level, by thanking the backer directly in the
commit's log message.  The nice thing about this is that it's
decentralized and easy to administer: any developer on the project can
help fulfill that reward.  Individual developers can also offer free
or discounted consulting about the project as a reward, though be
careful not to sell too much of your time: the point of the campaign
is to raise funds for development, not to turn the development team
into a consulting team.</p><p>One thing that many crowdfunding campaigns do that I think is
not appropriate for free software projects is to sell early access.
That is, one of the rewards will be a "sneak preview" or "beta access"
to in-progress versions, before the public release.  The problem with
this is that, for open source projects, the public is supposed to
already have access to in-progress work.  Access to an open source
project should be limited by the time and interest of the parties
<span class="emphasis"><em>seeking</em></span> the access, not by the project.  So learn
what you can from other crowdfunding campaigns, but remember that some
of the techniques used by most campaigns may not be suitable for an
open source project that wants to keep the good will of its users and
development community.</p><p>Finally, word of caution: if your project accepts donations, do
some public planning of how the money will be used
<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> it comes in.  Discussions about how to
allocate money tend to go a lot more smoothly when held before there's
actual money to spend; and anyway, if there are significant
disagreements, it's better to find that out when the money is still
theoretical than when it's real.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp2460" href="#idp2460" class="para">64</a>] </sup><a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_crowdfunding_services" target="_top">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_crowdfunding_services</a>.</p></div><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp2468" href="#idp2468" class="para">65</a>] </sup>One

succeed is unknowable as of this writing in mid-2015, since the

interest.  Snowdrift also did a thorough survey, in the Fall of 2013,
of funding platforms for free software, and posted their results at
