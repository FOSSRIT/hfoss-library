As your
software gets more popular, the number of people who show up looking
for information increases dramatically, while the number of people
able to provide information increases much more slowly.  Furthermore,
even if the ratio were evenly balanced, there is still a fundamental
scalability problem with the way most open source projects handle
communications.  Consider mailing lists, for example.  Most projects
have a mailing list for general user questions &#8212; sometimes the
list's name is "users", "discuss", "help", or something else.
Whatever its name, the purpose of the list is always the same: to
provide a place where people can get their questions answered, while
others watch and (presumably) absorb knowledge from observing these
exchanges.</p><p>These mailing lists work very well up to a few thousand users
and/or a couple of hundred posts a day.  But somewhere after that, the
system starts to break down, because every subscriber sees every post;
if the number of posts to the list begins to exceed what any
individual reader can process in a day, the list becomes a burden to
its members.  Imagine, for instance, if Microsoft had such a mailing
list for Windows.  Windows has hundreds of millions of users; if
even one-tenth of one percent of them had questions in a given
twenty-four hour period, then this hypothetical list would get
hundreds of thousands of posts per day!  Such a list could never
exist, of course, because no one would stay subscribed to it.
This problem is not limited to mailing lists; the same logic applies
to IRC channels, other discussion forums, indeed to any system in
which a group hears questions from individuals.  The implications are
ominous: the usual open source model of massively parallelized support
simply does not scale to the levels needed for world
domination.<sup>[<a name="idp2727" href="#ftn.idp2727" class="footnote">68</a>]</sup></p><p>There will be no explosion when forums reach the breaking point.
There is just a quiet negative feedback effect: people unsubscribe
from the lists, or leave the IRC channel, or at any rate stop
bothering to ask questions, because they can see they won't be heard
in all the noise.  As more and more people make this highly rational
choice, the forum's activity will seem to stay at a manageable level.
But it is staying manageable precisely because the rational (or at
least, experienced) people have started looking elsewhere for
information &#8212; while the inexperienced people stay behind and
continue posting.  In other words, one side effect of continuing to
use unscalable communications models as a project grows is that the
average <span class="emphasis"><em>quality</em></span> of communications tends to go
down.  As the benefit/cost ratio of using high-population forums
goes down, naturally those with the experience to do so start to look
elsewhere for answers first.  Adjusting communications mechanisms to
cope with project growth therefore involves two related strategies:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Recognizing when particular parts of a forum are
            <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> suffering unbounded growth, even
            if the forum as a whole is, and separating those parts
            off into new, more specialized forums (i.e., don't let
            the good be dragged down by the bad).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Making sure there are many automated sources
            of information available, and that they are kept
            organized, up-to-date, and easy to find.</p></li></ol></div><p>Strategy (1) is usually not too hard.  Most projects start out
with one main forum: a general discussion mailing list, on which
feature ideas, design questions, and coding problems can all be hashed
out.  Everyone involved with the project is on the list.  After a
while, it usually becomes clear that the list has evolved into several
distinct topic-based sublists.  For example, some threads are clearly
about development and design; others are user questions of the "How do
I do X?" variety; maybe there's a third topic family centered around
processing bug reports and enhancement requests; and so on.  A given
individual, of course, might participate in many different thread
types, but the important thing is that there is not a lot of overlap
between the types themselves.  They could be divided into separate
lists without causing harmful balkanization, because the threads
rarely cross topic boundaries.</p><p>Actually doing this division is a two-step process.  You create
the new list (or IRC channel, or whatever it is to be), and then you
spend whatever time is necessary gently nagging and reminding people
to <span class="emphasis"><em>use</em></span> the new forums appropriately.  That latter
step can last for weeks, but eventually people will get the idea.  You
simply have to make a point of always telling the sender when a post
is sent to the wrong destination, and do so visibly, so that other
people are encouraged to help out with routing.  It's also useful to
have a web page providing a guide to all the lists available; your
responses can simply reference that web page and, as a bonus, the
recipient may learn something about looking for guidelines before
posting.</p><p>Strategy (2) is an ongoing process, lasting the lifetime of the
project and involving many participants.  Of course it is partly a
matter of having up-to-date documentation (see
<a class="xref" href="getting-started.html#documentation" title="Documentation">the section called &#8220;Documentation&#8221;</a>) and making sure to
point people there.  But it is also much more than that; the sections
that follow discuss this strategy in detail.</p><div class="sect2" title="Conspicuous Use of Archives"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-archives"></a>Conspicuous Use of Archives</h3></div></div></div><p>Typically, all communications in an open source project, except
sometimes IRC conversations, are archived.  The archives are public
and searchable, and have referential stability: that is, once a given
piece of information is recorded at a particular address (URL), it
stays at that address forever.</p><p>Use those archives as much as possible, and as conspicuously as
possible.  Even when you know the answer to some question off the top
of your head, if you think there's a reference in the archives that
contains the answer, spend the time to dig it up and present it.
Every time you do that in a publicly visible way, some people learn
for the first time that the archives are there, and that searching in
them can produce answers.  Also, by referring to the archives instead
of rewriting the advice, you reinforce the social norm against
duplicating information.  Why have the same answer in two different
places?  When the number of places it can be found is kept to a
minimum, people who have found it before are more likely to remember
what to search for to find it again.  Well-placed references also
contribute to the quality of search results in general, because they
strengthen the targeted resource's ranking in Internet search
engines.</p><p>There are times when duplicating information makes sense,
however.  For example, suppose there's a response already in the
archives, not from you, saying:</p><pre class="screen">
It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  To
unfrobnicate them, run these steps:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Run the 'defrobnicate' program that ships with Scanley.
3. Start up the server.
</pre><p>Then, months later, you see another post indicating that
someone's indexes have become frobnicated.  You search the archives
and come up with the old response above, but you realize it's missing
some steps (perhaps by mistake, or perhaps because the software has
changed since that post was written).  The classiest way to handle
this is to post a new, more complete set of instructions, and
explicitly obsolete the old post by mentioning it:</p><pre class="screen">
It appears that your Scanley indexes have become frobnicated.  We
saw this problem back in July, and J. Random posted a solution at
http://blahblahblah/blah.  Below is a more complete description of
how to unfrobnicate your indexes, based on J. Random's instructions
but extending them a bit:

1. Shut down the Scanley server.
2. Become the user the Scanley server normally runs as.
3. As that user, run the 'defrobnicate' program on the indexes.
4. Run Scanley by hand to see if the indexes work now.
5. Restart the server.
</pre><p>(In an ideal world, it would be possible to attach a note to the
old post, saying that there is newer information available and
pointing to the new post.  However, I don't know of any archiving
software that offers an "obsoleted by" tag.  This is another reason
why creating dedicated web pages with answers to common questions is a
good idea.)</p><p>Archives are probably most often searched for answers to
technical questions, but their importance to the project goes well
beyond that.  If a project's formal guidelines are its statutory law,
the archives are its common law: a record of all decisions made and
how they were arrived at.  In any recurring discussion, it's pretty
much obligatory nowadays to start with an archive search.  This allows
you to begin the discussion with a summary of the current state of
things, anticipate objections, prepare rebuttals, and possibly
discover angles you hadn't thought of.  Also, the other participants
will <span class="emphasis"><em>expect</em></span> you to have done an archive search.
Even if the previous discussions went nowhere, you should include
pointers to them when you re-raise the topic, so people can see for
themselves a) that they went nowhere, and b) that you did your
homework, and therefore are probably saying something now that has not
been said before.</p><div class="sect3" title="Treat All Resources Like Archives"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="all-as-archives"></a>Treat All Resources Like Archives</h4></div></div></div><p>All of the preceding advice applies to more than just mailing
list archives.  Having particular pieces of information at stable,
conveniently findable addresses should be an organizing principle for
all of the project's information.  Let's take the project FAQ as a
case study.</p><p>How do people use a FAQ?</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>They want to search in it for specific words and phrases.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore: the FAQ should be available in some
    sort of textual format.</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They expect search engines such as Google to know about the
          FAQ's content, so that searches can result in FAQ entries.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore: the FAQ should be available as an HTML
    page.</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They want to browse it, soaking up information without
    necessarily looking for answers to specific questions.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore: the FAQ should not only be available as
    an HTML page, it should be designed for easy browseability and
    have a table of contents.</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to refer other people directly to specific
          items in the FAQ.</p><p><a name="html-named-anchors-and-ids"></a><span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore: each
    individual entry in the FAQ should be directly addresseable via a
    direct URL (e.g., using HTML IDs and named anchors, which are tags
    that allow people to reach a particular location on the
    page).</em></span></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>They want to be able to add new material to the FAQ, but
          note that this happens much less often than answers are
          looked up &#8212; FAQs are far more often read from than
          written to.</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>Therefore: the source files for the FAQ should be
    conveniently available (see <a class="xref" href="vc.html#version-everything" title="Version Everything">the section called &#8220;Version Everything&#8221;</a>), in a format that's
    easy to edit.</em></span></p></li></ol></div><p>Formatting the FAQ like this is just one example of how to make
a resource presentable.  The same properties &#8212; direct
searchability, availability to major Internet search engines,
browsability, referential stability, and (where applicable)
editability &#8212; apply to other web pages, to the source code tree,
to the bug tracker, to Q&amp;A forums, etc.  It just happens that most
mailing list archiving software long ago recognized the importance of
these properties, which is why mailing lists tend to have this
functionality natively, while other formats may require a little extra
effort on the maintainer's part.  <a class="xref" href="managing-participants.html" title="Chapter 8. Managing Participants">Chapter 8, <i>Managing Participants</i></a> discusses how to spread that
maintenance burden across many participants.</p></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Codifying Tradition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="codifying-tradition"></a>Codifying Tradition</h3></div></div></div><p>As a project acquires history and complexity, the amount of data
each new incoming participant must absorb increases.  Those who have been
with the project a long time were able to learn, and invent, the
project's conventions as they went along.  They will often not be
consciously aware of what a huge body of tradition has accumulated, and
may be surprised at how many missteps recent newcomers seem to make.
Of course, the issue is not that the newcomers are of any lower
quality than before; it's that they face a bigger acculturation burden
than newcomers did in the past.</p><p>The traditions a project accumulates are as much about how to
communicate and preserve information as they are about coding
standards and other technical minutae.  We've already looked at both
sorts of standards, in
<a class="xref" href="getting-started.html#developer-documentation" title="Developer Documentation">the section called &#8220;Developer Documentation&#8221;</a> and
<a class="xref" href="written-rules.html" title="Writing It All Down">the section called &#8220;Writing It All Down&#8221;</a> respectively, and
examples are given there.  What this section is about is how to keep
such guidelines up-to-date as the project evolves, especially
guidelines about how communications are managed, because those are the
ones that change the most as the project grows in size and
complexity.</p><p>First, watch for patterns in how people get confused.  If you
see the same situations coming up over and over, especially with new
participants, chances are there is a guideline that needs to be
documented but isn't.  Second, don't get tired of saying the same
things over and over again, and don't <span class="emphasis"><em>sound</em></span> like
you're tired of saying them.  You and other project veterans will have
to repeat yourselves often; this is an inevitable side effect of the
arrival of newcomers.</p><p>Every web page, every mailing list message, and every IRC channel
should be considered advertising space &#8212; not for commercial
advertisements, but for ads about your project's own resources.  What
you put in that space depends on the demographics of those likely to
read it.  An IRC channel for user questions, for example, is likely to
get people who have never interacted with the project
before &#8212; often someone who has just installed the software, and
has a question he'd like answered immediately (after all, if it
could wait, he'd have sent it to a mailing list instead, which would
probably use less of his total time, although it would take longer
for an answer to come back).  Most people don't make a permanent
investment in a support IRC channel; they'll show up, ask their question,
and leave.</p><p>Therefore, the channel topic should be aimed at people looking
for technical answers about the software <span class="emphasis"><em>right
now</em></span>, rather than at, say, people who might get involved
with the project in a long term way and for whom community interaction
guidelines might be more appropriate.</p><p>With mailing lists, the "ad space" is a tiny footer appended to
every message.  Most projects put subscription/unsubscription
instructions there, and perhaps a pointer to the project's home page
or FAQ page as well.  You might think that anyone subscribed to the
list would know where to find those things, and they probably
do &#8212; but many more people than just subscribers see those mailing
list messages.  An archived post may be linked to from many places;
indeed, some posts become so widely known that they eventually have
more readers off the list than on it.</p><p>Formatting can make a big difference.  For example, in the
Subversion project, we were having limited success using the
bug-filtering technique described in
<a class="xref" href="bug-tracker.html#bug-filtering" title="Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker">the section called &#8220;Pre-Filtering the Bug Tracker&#8221;</a>.  Many bogus
bug reports were still being filed by inexperienced people, and each
time it happened, the filer had to be educated in exactly the same way
as the 500 people before him.  One day, after one of our developers had
finally gotten to the end of his rope and flamed some poor user who
didn't read the ticket tracker guidelines carefully enough, another
developer decided this pattern had gone on long enough.  He suggested
that we reformat the ticket tracker front page so that the most
important part, the injunction to discuss the bug on the mailing lists
or IRC channels before filing, would stand out in huge, bold red
letters, on a bright yellow background, centered prominently above
everything else on the page.  We did so (it's been reformatted a bit
since then, but it's still very prominent &#8212; you can see the results at
<a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org/reporting-issues.html</a>), and
the result was a noticeable drop in the rate of bogus ticket filings.
The project still gets them, of course &#8212; it always will &#8212; but the rate
has slowed considerably, even as the number of users increases.  The
outcome is not only that the bug database contains less junk, but that
those who respond to ticket filings stay in a better mood, and are more
likely to remain friendly when responding to one of the now-rare bogus
filings.  This improves both the project's image and the mental health
of its participants.</p><p>The lesson for us was that merely writing up the guidelines was
not enough.  We also had to put them where they'd be seen by those who
need them most, and format them in such a way that their status as
introductory material would be immediately clear to people unfamiliar
with the project.</p><p>Static web pages are not the only venue for advertising the
project's customs.  A certain amount of interactive monitoring (in the
friendly-reminder sense, not the prison-panopticon sense) is also
required.  All peer review, even the commit reviews described in
<a class="xref" href="setting-tone.html#code-review" title="Practice Conspicuous Code Review">the section called &#8220;Practice Conspicuous Code Review&#8221;</a>, should include review
of people's conformance or non-conformance with project norms,
especially with regard to communications conventions.</p><p>Another example from the Subversion project: we settled on a
convention of "r12908" to mean "revision 12908 in the version control
repository."  The lower-case "r" prefix is easy to type, and because
it's half the height of the digits, it makes an easily-recognizable
block of text when combined with the digits.  Of course, settling on
the convention doesn't mean that everyone will begin using it
consistently right away.  Thus, when a commit mail comes in with a log
message like this:</p><pre class="screen">

Patch from J. Random Contributor &lt;jrcontrib@gmail.com&gt;

* trunk/contrib/client-side/psvn/psvn.el:
  Fixed some typos from revision 12828.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre><p>...part of reviewing that commit is to say "By the way, please
use 'r12828', not 'revision 12828' when referring to past changes."
This isn't just pedantry; it's important as much for automatic
parsability as for human readership.</p><p>By following the general principle that there should be
canonical referral methods for common entities, and that these
referral methods should be used consistently everywhere, the project
in effect exports certain standards.  Those standards enable people to
write tools that present the project's communications in more useable
ways &#8212; for example, a revision formatted as "r12828" could be
transformed into a live link into the repository browsing system.
This would be harder to do if the revision were written as "revision
12828", both because that form could be divided across a line break,
and because it's less distinct (the word "revision" will often appear
alone, and groups of numbers will often appear alone, whereas the
combination "r12828" can only mean a revision number).  Similar
concerns apply to ticket numbers, FAQ items, etc.<sup>[<a name="idp2803" href="#ftn.idp2803" class="footnote">69</a>]</sup>
</p><p>(Note that for Git commit IDs, the widely-accepted standard
syntax is "<code class="code">commit c03dd89305</code>, that is, the word
"commit", followed by a space, followed by the first 8-10 characters
of the commit hash.  Some very busy projects have standardized on 12
characters, to avoid collisions; the only time all 40 characters of
the hash are used is in non-human-readable contexts, like saving a
commit ID in an automated release-tracking system or something.)</p><p>Even for entities where there is not an obvious short, canonical
form, people should still be encouraged to provide key pieces of
information consistently.  For example, when referring to a mailing
list message, don't just give the sender and subject; also give the
archive URL <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> the Message-ID header.  The last
allows people who have their own copy of the mailing list (people
sometimes keep offline copies, for example to use on a laptop while
traveling) to unambiguously identify the right message in a search even if they
don't have access to the archives.  The sender and subject wouldn't be
enough, because the same person might make several posts in the same
thread, even on the same day.</p><p>The more a project grows, the more important this sort of
consistency becomes.  Consistency means that everywhere people look,
they see the same patterns being followed, and start to follow
those patterns themselves.  This, in turn, reduces the number of
questions they need to ask.  The burden of having a million readers is
no greater than that of having one; scalability problems start to
arise only when a certain percentage of those readers ask questions.
As a project grows, therefore, it must reduce that percentage by
increasing the density and findability of information, so that any
given person is more likely to find what he needs without having to
ask.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp2727" href="#idp2727" class="para">68</a>] </sup>An interesting experiment would be a
