open source software, and participating in existing open source
projects; I'll also look at government usage of open source software,
to the extent that it overlaps with those main topics.</p><p>Since the first edition of this book in 2005, I've worked with
various U.S. government agencies, at the federal, state, and municipal
levels, to help them release open source software.  I've also been
lucky enough to observe, and in a few cases work with, some government
agencies outside the U.S.  These experiences have convinced me of one
thing: government is different.  If you work at a government agency
and the material in this book so far has made you shake your head and
think "Sure, but it'll never work here", you don't have to convince
me &#8212; I already know what you mean.  Governments differ
from individuals and from private-sector organizations in some
fundamental ways:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Governments often aren't trying to retain technical
  expertise in-house (that's what contractors are for).</li><li class="listitem">Governments have labyrinthine and in certain ways
  inflexible procurement and employment policies.  These policies can
  make it difficult for a government agency to be nimbly responsive in
  an open source development community.</li><li class="listitem">Government agencies tend to be unusually risk-averse.
  Somewhere at the top there's an elected official who, reasonably,
  sees an open source project as just one more surface area for
  opponents to attack.  After all, when development happens in public,
  the inevitable false starts and wrong turns are also public; if
  development were internal, no one else would know about it when
  those things happen.</li><li class="listitem">Government officials hunger for well-timed and
  well-controlled publicity events.  This has certain benefits, but it
  can sometimes come at the expense of overall project health.
  This need for publicity is the complement of being risk-averse:
  elected officials and those who work for them understand that most
  people aren't paying much attention most of the
  time &#8212; therefore, those who work in government want
  to ensure that in the few moments when people
  <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> paying attention, they see something
  good.  This is understandable, but it can cause them to delay
  certain actions &#8212; or, in some cases, do them too
  soon &#8212; based on external publicity implications
  rather than on what's best for the project technically and
  socially.</li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>There are good reasons for all of these things; they've been
true for decades if not centuries, and they're not going to change.
So if you're a government agency and you want to start a successful
open source project, certain adjustments will be necessary to
compensate for the structural idiosyncracies above.  The advice that
follows is most applicable to the U.S. and countries with similar
systems of government and civil service.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="starting-open-for-govs"></a>Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects</h2></div></div></div><p>In ???<span> in <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html" title="Chapter 2. &#2980;&#3018;&#2975;&#2969;&#3021;&#2965;&#3009;&#2980;&#2994;&#3021;">Chapter 2, <i>&#2980;&#3018;&#2975;&#2969;&#3021;&#2965;&#3009;&#2980;&#2994;&#3021;</i></a></span>, I
explained why it's best for an open source project to be run in the
open from the very beginning.

government code.</p><p>Government projects have greater potential to be harmed by a
needless exposure event than private-sector projects have.  Elected
officials and those who work for them are understandably sensitive to
negative public comments.  Thus even for the most conscientious team,
a worrying cloud of uncertainty will surround everything by the time
you're ready to open up hitherto closed code.  How can you ever know
you've got it all cleaned up?  You do your best, but you can never be
totally sure some hawk-eyed hacker out there won't spot something
embarrassing after the release.  The team worries, and worry is an
energy drain: it causes them to spend time chasing down ghosts, and at
the same time can cause them to unconsciously avoid steps that might
risk revealing real problems.</p><p>This concern doesn't only apply to government software, of
course.  But in the private sector, businesses sometimes have
competitive reasons to stay behind the curtain until their first
release, even if they intend for the project to be open source in the
long run.  Government projects should not have that motivation to
start out closed, at least in theory, and they have even more to
lose.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="forks.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"> </td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="rfi-rfp-contract-review.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Forks </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Review Your RFI, RFP and Contract Language</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
