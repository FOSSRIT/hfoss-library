<em class="firstterm">proprietary relicensing</em>
scheme<sup>[<a id="idp9576304" href="#ftn.idp9576304" class="footnote">71</a>]</sup>, in which an open source version of the
software is available under the usual open source terms, while a
proprietary version is available for a fee.</p><p>Why would anyone want a proprietary version, when an open source
version is already out there?  There are two separate answers,
reflecting the two different types of proprietary relicensing.</p><p>The first kind is about <em class="firstterm">selling
exceptions</em> to copyleft requirements, and is typically used
with code libraries rather than with standalone applications.  The way
it works is that the library's owner (i.e., copyright holder), seeing
that some of the library's users want to incorporate it into their own
proprietary applications, sells them a promise to
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> enforce the redistribution requirements of
the open source version's license.  This only works when the open
source code is under a copyleft-style license, of
course — in practice it is usually the GPL or
AGPL.</p><p>With this promise in hand, the downstream users can use the
library in their proprietary product without worry that they might be
forced to share the source code to the full product under the copyleft
license.  One well-known example of "selling exceptions" is the MySQL
database engine, which is distributed under the GPL version 2, but
with a proprietary license offering available for many years, first
from the Swedish company MySQL AB, and later from Oracle, Inc, which
purchased MySQL AB in 2008.</p><p>The second kind of proprietary relicensing, sometimes called the
<em class="firstterm">freemium</em> model, uses an open source version to
drive sales of a presumably fancier proprietary version.  Usually the
company offering the proprietary version is also the primary
maintainer of the open source version, in the sense of supplying most
of the developer attention (this is usually inevitable, for reasons
we'll get to in a moment).  Furthermore, although in theory the
company <span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> offer paid support for both the
open source and proprietary versions, in practice they almost
always only offer it for the proprietary version, because then they
can charge two fees: a subscription fee for the software itself and a
fee for the support services, with only the latter having any marginal
cost to the supplier.</p><p>You might be wondering: how can the copyright holder offer the
software under a proprietary license if the terms of the GNU GPL
stipulate that the code must be available under less restrictive
terms?  The answer is that the GPL's terms are something the copyright
holder imposes on everyone else; the owner is therefore free to decide
<span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> to apply those terms to itself.  In other
words, one always has the right to not sue one's self for copyright
infringement.  This right is not tied to the GPL or any other open
source license; it is simply in the nature of copyright law.</p><p>Proprietary relicensing of both kinds tends to discourage the
normal dynamics of open source projects, however.  The problem is that
any code contributors from outside the company are now effectively
contributing to two distinct entities: the free version of the code
and the proprietary version.  While the contributor will be
comfortable helping the free version, since that's the norm in open
source projects, she may feel less enthusiastic about her
contributions being useable by a monopolized proprietary
product — that is, unlike a straight non-copyleft
license by which anyone has the right to use the code as part of a
proprietary work, here exactly one party controls that right, and
other participants in the project are thus being asked to contribute
to an asymmetric result.  This awkwardness is reflected and in some
ways amplified by the fact that in a proprietary relicensing scheme,
the copyright owner must collect some kind of formal agreement from
each contributor (see <a class="xref" href="ch10s06.html" title="Contributor Agreements">“Contributor Agreements”</a> earlier
in this chapter), in order to have the right to redistribute that
contributor's code under a proprietary license.  Because such an
agreement needs to give the collecting entity special rights that a
typical open source contributor agreement doesn't include, the process
of collecting agreements means that contributors are starkly
confronted with the imbalance of the situation, and some of them may
decline to sign.  (Remember, they don't need to sign a contribution
agreement in order to distribute their own changes along with the
original code; rather, the company needs the agreement in order to
redistribute the <span class="emphasis"><em>contributor's</em></span> changes,
especially under a proprietary license.  Asymmetry cuts both
ways.)</p><p>There is also a deeper motivational issue with open source
projects that operate in the shadow of a proprietarily relicensed
version: the sense that most of the salaried development attention is
going to the proprietary version anyway, and that therefore spending
time contributing to the open source version is a fool's
game — that one is just helping a commercial entity
free up its own developers to work on features that the open source
community will never see.  This fear is reasonable on its face, but it
also becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: as more outside developers
stay away, the company sees less reason to invest in the open source
code base, because they're not getting the community multiplier
effect.  Their disengagement in turn discourages outside developers,
and so on.</p><p>What seems to happen in practice is that companies that offer
proprietarily relicensed software do not get truly active development
communities with external participants.  They get occasional
small-scale bug fixes and cleanup patches from the outside, but end up
doing most of the hard work with internal resources.  Since this book
is about running free software projects, I will just say that in my
experience, proprietary relicensing schemes inevitably have a negative
effect on the level of community engagement and the level of technical
quality on the open source side.  If you conclude that for business
reasons you want to try it anyway, then I hope this section will at
least help you mitigate some of those effects.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp9576304" href="#idp9576304" class="para">71</a>] </sup>This is sometimes also called <em class="firstterm">dual
licensing</em>, but that term is ambiguous, as it has
historically also referred to releasing open source software under two
or more open source licenses simultaneously.  I am grateful to Bradley
Kuhn for pointing out this ambiguity and suggesting the more accurate
term.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
