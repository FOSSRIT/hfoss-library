experience, you have a big advantage compared to hiring other kinds of
developers.  Most of the résumé of an open source developer is
public &#8212; it's everything they've ever done in every
open source project they've ever worked on, because all of that
activity is publicly archived.<sup>[<a name="idp2388" href="#ftn.idp2388" class="footnote">61</a>]</sup>
But you shouldn't need to go searching for all of it.  When you put
out a job posting, tell prospective candidates directly that the
résumé they send in should include references to their open source
profile.  This means their committer accounts on the projects where
they've been active (or their account names at the overall project
hosting sites where they're been active, e.g., their GitHub.com
username), the email addresses or usernames they have used when
posting in discussion forums, documentation they have written, and
anything else that would lead you to places where you can see their
open source project activity.</p><p>The kind of activity to look for is not only their direct
technical activity, but also their relations with the other developers
in the project.  So look at the candidate's commits, but look also at
the frequency with which they reviewed <span class="emphasis"><em>others'</em></span>
commits, and at their reaction to reviews of their own commits.  In
the project's issue tracker, how often did the candidate respond
constructively to incoming bug reports or contribute useful
information to a bug ticket?  Visit a threaded view of the project's
discussion forums and see how often the candidate's posts were
responded to, and what the general tone of the responses was.  Someone
who consistently causes negative reactions from others in the project
may have social problems as a collaborator, which is important to know
independently of the candidate's raw technical ability.</p><p>If candidate is applying for a position that would involve
working on an open source project, but seems to have little or no open
source experience themselves, this is not necessarily a showstopper,
but it's a sign that you should ask some probing questions, and that
you should expect some ramp-up time if you hire them.  If the
candidate is young and inexperienced in general, then lack of
participation in open source is easy to understand.  However, if the
candidate has been a programmer for a while, and especially if they
already have experience as a user of some of the open source software
you'd be hiring them to work on, and yet they have never participated
much in that project except to download and use it, then you should
ask them questions about why.  There is nothing wrong with being
uninvolved as a participant in software that one uses.  However, if
you're hiring someone to <span class="emphasis"><em>be</em></span> a participant in a
project, and they already had a chance to be and chose not to, that
could imply a lack of intrinsic motivation to participate and may indicate
that this person's temperament is not what you're looking for.  Or
there could be other reasons &#8212; for example, the
candidate's prior management forbade them from participating.
Whatever the reasons are, you should make sure you find out.</p><div class="sect2" title="Hiring for Influence"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="hiring-for-influence"></a>Hiring for Influence</h3></div></div></div><p>It is very common for companies to hire an open source developer
precisely <span class="emphasis"><em>because</em></span> of her existing position in an
open source project.  She may be the founder or leader of the project,
or may just have commit access<sup>[<a name="idp2402" href="#ftn.idp2402" class="footnote">62</a>]</sup>, but
either way her ability to get things done in the upstream community is
part of her value as a prospective employee; often, it is just as
important as raw technical skill.</p><p>As noted in <a class="xref" href="money.html#economics-of-open-source" title="The Economics of Open Source">the section called &#8220;The Economics of Open Source&#8221;</a>, there is
nothing wrong with purchasing influence in this way, as long as the
employer understands that the new employee will have dual loyalty.  It
is inappropriate to ask the employee to take actions that would harm
her standing in the project.  The employee's manager needs to be
sensitive to this, and to let the employee know that the door is open
for discussion and pushback if she ever feels she's being put into
such a situation (hence the importance of managers who understand open
source, as described in <a class="xref" href="open-source-and-the-organization.html#middle-management" title="The Key Role of Middle Management">the section called &#8220;The Key Role of Middle Management&#8221;</a>).  It is
perfectly fine for the employee to promote the company's technical
interests in the project, and to do so openly, as long as the
proposals are compatible with the project's overall goals and the
company provides resources to support those proposals in a way that's
sustainable for the project.</p><p>Remember that influence in an upstream project is usually not
transferable to some other employee.  Position and influence travel
with the person, not with the employer.  There are occasional
exceptions to this, e.g., in corporate-driven projects where the
balance of power among competitors is especially important, or in
standards bodies with formal representation policies.  In these cases,
a governance committee seat may be reserved for a certain company, and
the company gets to designate who sits in that seat.  But even then,
informal influence tends to matter a lot, and individuals may not be
truly interchangeable in practice.</p><p>This makes the recommendations in <a class="xref" href="long-term-developers.html" title="Hire for the Long Term">the section called &#8220;Hire for the Long Term&#8221;</a> all the more important.  When an
employee holds a position of influence in an open source project that
is strategically important to your company, that employee has a pretty
good bargaining position.</p><p>Since that kind of employee is likely to be with you for the
long term, try to take advantage of it by having her help onboard
others into open source projects.  Nithya Ruff, 
Director of Open Source Strategy at Western Digital, told me
that when her company acquired another company that had a history
of working on certain strategically important (to the acquirer) open
source projects, the engineering team that came with the acquisition
became a strong influence inside the newly combined company.  The
developers had good reputations in the upstream projects, and the new
management not only made sure they were able to continue working in
those projects, but brought them into a company-wide open source
working group to help other engineers get involved in upstream
maintenance too.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp2388" href="#idp2388" class="para">61</a>] </sup>Brian Fitzpatrick has
