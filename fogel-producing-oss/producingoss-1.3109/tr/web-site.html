from a technical point of view: setting up a web server and writing
web pages are fairly simple tasks, and most of the important things to
say about layout and arrangement were covered in the previous chapter.
The web site's main function is to present a clear and welcoming
overview of the project, and to bind together the other tools (the
version control system, bug tracker, etc.).  If you don't have the
expertise to set up a web server yourself, it's usually not hard to
find someone who does and is willing to help out.  Nonetheless, to
save time and effort, people often prefer to use one of the canned
hosting sites.</p><div class="sect2" title="Canned Hosting"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting"></a>Canned Hosting</h3></div></div></div><p>There are two main advantages to using a canned site.  The first
is server capacity and bandwidth: their servers are beefy boxes sitting
on really fat pipes.  No matter how successful your project gets,
you're not going to run out of disk space or swamp the network
connection.  The second advantage is simplicity.  They have already
chosen a bug tracker, a version control system, a mailing list manager,
an archiver, and everything else you need to run a site.  They've
configured the tools, and are taking care of backups for all the data
stored in the tools.  You don't need to make many decisions.  All you
have to do is fill in a form, press a button, and suddenly you've got
a project web site.</p><p>These are pretty significant benefits.  The disadvantage, of
course, is that you must accept <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> choices and
configurations, even if something different would be better for your
project.  Usually canned sites are adjustable within certain narrow
parameters, but you will never get the fine-grained control you would
have if you set up the site yourself and had full administrative
access to the server.</p><p>A perfect example of this is the handling of generated files.
Certain project web pages may be generated files&#8212;for example,
there are systems for keeping FAQ data in an easy-to-edit master
format, from which HTML, PDF, and other presentation formats can be
generated.  As explained in
<a class="xref" href="vc.html#version-everything" title="Version everything"> &#8220;Version everything&#8221;</a><span>
earlier in this chapter</span>,
you wouldn't want to version the generated formats, only the master
file.  But when your web site is hosted on someone else's server, it
may be impossible to set up a custom hook to regenerate the online
HTML version of the FAQ whenever the master file is changed.  The only
workaround is to version the generated formats too, so that they show
up on the web site.</p><p>There can be larger consequences as well.  You may not have as
much control over presentation as you would wish.  Some of the canned
hosting sites allow you to customize your web pages, but the site's
default layout usually ends up showing through in various awkward
ways.  For example, some projects that host themselves at SourceForge
have completely customized home pages, but still point developers to
their "SourceForge page" for more information.  The SourceForge page
is what would be the project's home page, had the project not used a
custom home page.  The SourceForge page has links to the bug tracker,
the CVS repository, downloads, etc.  Unfortunately, a SourceForge page
also contains a great deal of extraneous noise.  The top is a banner
ad, often an animated image.  The left side is a vertical arrangement
of links of little relevance to someone interested in the project.
The right side is often another advertisement.  Only the center of the
page is devoted to truly project-specific material, and even that is
arranged in a confusing way that often makes visitors unsure of what
to click on next.</p><p>Behind every individual aspect of SourceForge's design, there is
no doubt a good reason&#8212;good from SourceForge's point of view,
such as the advertisements.  But from an individual project's point of
view, the result can be a less-than-ideal web page.  I don't mean to
pick on SourceForge; similar concerns apply to many of the canned
hosting sites.  The point is that there's a tradeoff.  You get relief
from the technical burdens of running a project site, but only at the
price of accepting someone else's way of running it.</p><p>Only you can decide whether canned hosting is best for your
project.  If you choose a canned site, leave open the option of
switching to your own servers later, by using a custom domain name for
the project's "home address".  You can forward the URL to the canned
site, or have a fully customized home page at the public URL and hand
users off to the canned site for sophisticated functionality.  Just
make sure to arrange things such that if you later decide to use a
different hosting solution, the project's address doesn't need to
change.</p><div class="sect3" title="Choosing a canned hosting site"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="canned-hosting-choosing"></a>Choosing a canned hosting site</h4></div></div></div><p>The largest and most well-known hosting site is <a class="ulink" href="http://www.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">SourceForge</a>.  Two other
sites providing the same or similar services are <a class="ulink" href="http://savannah.gnu.org/" target="_top">savannah.gnu.org</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.berlios.de/" target="_top">BerliOS.de</a>.  A few organizations,
such as the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.apache.org/" target="_top">Apache Software
Foundation</a> and <a class="ulink" href="http://www.tigris.org/" target="_top">Tigris.org</a><sup>[<a name="idp868064" href="#ftn.idp868064" class="footnote">21</a>]</sup>, give free
hosting to open source projects that fit well with their missions and
their community of existing projects.</p><p>Haggen So did a thorough evaluation of various canned hosting
sites, as part of the research for his Ph.D. thesis,
<em class="citetitle">Construction of an Evaluation Model for Free/Open Source
Project Hosting (FOSPHost) sites</em>.  The results are at
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/" target="_top">http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/</a>, and see especially
the very readable comparison chart at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/exhost.htm" target="_top">http://www.ibiblio.org/fosphost/exhost.htm</a>.</p></div><div class="sect3" title="Anonymity and involvement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="anonymity"></a>Anonymity and involvement</h4></div></div></div><p>A problem that is not strictly limited to the canned sites, but
is most often found there, is the abuse of user login functionality.
The functionality itself is simple enough: the site allows each
visitor to register herself with a username and password.  From
then on it keeps a profile for that user, and project administrators
can assign the user certain permissions, for example, the right to
commit to the repository.</p><p>This can be extremely useful, and in fact it's one of the prime
advantages of canned hosting.  The problem is that sometimes user
login ends up being required for tasks that ought to be permitted to
unregistered visitors, specifically the ability to file issues in the
bug tracker, and to comment on existing issues.  By requiring a
logged-in username for such actions, the project raises the
involvement bar for what should be quick, convenient tasks.  Of
course, one wants to be able to contact someone who's entered data
into the issue tracker, but having a field where she can enter her
email address (if she wants to) is sufficient.  If a new user spots a
bug and wants to report it, she'll only be annoyed at having to fill
out an account creation form before she can enter the bug into the
tracker.  She may simply decide not to file the bug at all.</p><p>The advantages of user management generally outweigh the
disadvantages.  But if you can choose which actions can be done
anonymously, make sure not only that <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
read-only actions are permitted to non-logged-in visitors, but also
some data entry actions, especially in the bug tracker and, if you
have them, wiki pages.</p></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp868064" href="#idp868064" class="para">21</a>] </sup>Disclaimer:
