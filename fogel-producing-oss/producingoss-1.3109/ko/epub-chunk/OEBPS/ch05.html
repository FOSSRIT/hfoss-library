Money"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="money"/>5장. Money</h1></div></div></div><div class="simplesect"><div class="titlepage"/><p>This chapter examines how to use money constructively in a free
software environment.  It is aimed not only at developers who are paid
to work on open source projects, but also at their managers (and even
on up to the executives), who need to understand the social dynamics
of the development environment and how money affects them.</p><p>Sometimes people are surprised to learn that most free software
is written by paid developers, not by volunteers.  But when you think
about it, it makes sense: a company often needs a particular piece of
software to exist, and to be maintained and developed, and yet does
not need a monopoly on that software.  Lots of companies have web
sites and therefore need a web server; far fewer companies need
exclusive control over the development of their web server, or need to
sell it on a proprietary basis.  The same is true of office software
suites, operating system kernels, network connectivity tools,
educational programs, etc — just as historically it
has been true of electric grids, roads, sewer systems, and other goods
that everyone needs but no one needs to own.  Just as we expect road
workers to be paid, we should expect software developers to be paid as
well.</p><p>Even in the early days of free software, although the proportion
of truly unpaid volunteers was certainly higher, there were also paid
developers — and a good deal of informal subsidy as
well, as there continues to be today.  When a system administrator
writes a network analysis tool to help her do her job, then posts it
online and gets bug fixes and feature contributions from other system
administrators, what's happened is that an unofficial consortium has
been formed.  The consortium's funding comes from the sysadmins'
salaries, and its office space and network bandwidth are donated,
albeit unknowingly, by the organizations they work for.  Those
organizations benefitted from the investment, of course, although they
may not be institutionally aware of it at first.</p><p>Today these efforts tend to be more formalized.  Corporations
have become conscious of the benefits of open source software, and now
involve themselves directly in its development.  Developers too have
come to expect that really important projects will attract funding in
one way or another.  The question is just how the hierarchical command
structures of corporations and the semi-decentralized, non-coercive
communities of free software projects can work productively with each
other — and more or less agree on what "productively"
means.</p><p>Financial backing is generally welcomed by open source
development communities.  Paid developers mean that bug reports are
more likely to be listened to, that needed work is more likely to get
done, and that the project will be less vulnerable to the Forces of
Chaos (e.g., a key founding developer suddenly losing interest).
After all, credibility is contagious, to a point.  When, for example,
Google backs an open source project, people assume the project will
have the chance to succeed or fail on its merits, with adequate
support in its early stages; their resultant willingness to devote
effort to it can then make this a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p>However, funding can also bring a perception of control.  If not
handled carefully, money can divide a project into in-group and
out-group developers.  If developers who aren't officially paid to
work on the project get the feeling that design decisions or feature
additions are simply available to the highest bidder, they'll head off
to a project that seems more like a meritocracy and less like unpaid
labor for someone else's benefit.  They may never complain overtly on
the mailing lists.  Instead, there will simply be less and less noise
from external sources, as the volunteers gradually stop trying to be
taken seriously.  The buzz of small-scale activity will continue, in
the form of bug reports and occasional small fixes.  But there won't
be any large code contributions or outside participation in design
discussions.  People sense what's expected of them, and live up (or
down) to those expectations.</p><p>Although money needs to be used carefully, that doesn't mean it
can't buy influence.  It most certainly can.  The trick is that it
can't buy influence directly.  In a straightforward commercial
transaction, you trade money for what you want.  If you need a feature
added, you sign a contract, pay for it, and (if all goes well) the
work gets done and the feature eventually lands in the product.  In an
open source project, it's not so simple.  You may sign a contract with
some developers, but they'd be fooling themselves—and
you—if they guaranteed that the work you paid for would be
accepted by the development community simply because you paid for it.
The work can only be accepted on its own merits and on how it fits
into the community's vision for the software.  You may have some say
in that vision, but you won't be the only voice.</p><p>So money can't purchase influence, but it can purchase things
that <span class="emphasis"><em>lead to</em></span> influence.  The most obvious example
is programmers.  If you hire good programmers, and they stick around
long enough to get experience with the software and credibility in the
community, then they can influence the project by the same means as
any other member.  They will have a vote, or if there are many of
them, they will have a voting bloc.  If they are respected in the
project, they will have influence beyond just their votes.  There is
no need for paid developers to disguise their motives, either.  After
all, everyone who wants a change made to the software wants it for a
reason.  Your company's reasons are no less legitimate than anyone
else's.  It's just that the weight given to your company's goals will
be determined by its representatives' status in the project, not by
your company's size, budget, or business plan.<sup>[<a id="idp7036912" href="#ftn.idp7036912" class="footnote">40</a>]</sup></p><div class="sidebar" title="&quot;Commercial&quot; vs &quot;Proprietary&quot;"><a id="commercial-vs-proprietary"/><div class="titlepage"><div><div><p class="title"><strong>"Commercial" vs "Proprietary"</strong></p></div></div></div><p><span class="emphasis"><em>possv2 todo: write a sidebar here pointing out ohw

companies need to guarantee that certain features and bug fixes land
in a specified amount of time, they accomplish this by keeping their
own copy (which may be partially or wholly public) of the project, and
merging it from time to time with a separate public copy that has its
own governance.  Google's Android operating system is a classic
example: Google maintains its own copy of Android, which it governs
pleases, and from time to time merges changes between that copy and
the <a class="ulink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29#Open-source_community">Android Open Source Project</a>.  Essentially, Google is on a
very long copy-modify-merge loop with respect to the open source
project, or perhaps it's the other way around.  In any case, it is in
neither side's interests to permanently diverge from the
other.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
