various U.S. government agencies, at the federal, state, and municipal
levels, to help them develop and release open source software.  I've also been
lucky enough to observe, and in a few cases work with, some government
agencies outside the U.S.  These experiences have convinced me of one
thing: <span class="emphasis"><em>government is different</em></span>.  If you work at a government agency
and the material in this book so far has made you shake your head and
think "Sure, but it'll never work here", you have my sympathy
 — I know exactly what you mean.  Governments differ
from individuals and from private-sector organizations in some
fundamental ways:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Governments often aren't trying to retain technical
  expertise in-house.  That's what contractors are for, after all.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Governments have labyrinthine and in certain ways
  inflexible procurement and employment policies.  These policies can
  make it difficult for a government agency to be nimbly responsive in
  an open source development community.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Government agencies tend to be unusually risk-averse.
  Somewhere at the top there's an elected official who, reasonably,
  sees an open source project as just one more surface area for
  opponents to attack.  After all, when development happens in public,
  the inevitable false starts and wrong turns are also public; if
  development were internal, no one else would know about it when
  those things happen.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Government officials hunger for well-timed and
  well-controlled publicity events.  This has certain benefits, but it
  can sometimes come at the expense of overall project health.
  This need for publicity is the complement of being risk-averse:
  elected officials and those who work for them understand that most
  people aren't paying much attention most of the
  time — therefore, those who work in government want
  to ensure that in the few moments when people
  <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> paying attention, they see something
  good.  This is understandable, but it can cause them to delay
  certain actions — or, in some cases, do them too
  soon — based on external publicity implications
  rather than on what's best for the project technically and
  socially.</p></li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>There are good reasons for all of these things; they've been
true for decades if not centuries, and they're not going to change.
So if you're a government agency and you want to start a successful
open source project, certain adjustments will be necessary to
compensate for the structural idiosyncracies mentioned above.  Much of
that advice is also applicable to non-governmental organizations, and
is already present elsewhere in this chapter, so what I'll do here is
simply list the sections that I think are <span class="emphasis"><em>most</em></span>
important for a government agency:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="xref" href="ch05s08.html#rfi-rfp-contract-language" title="Update Your RFI, RFP and Contract Language">Update Your RFI, RFP and Contract Language</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="xref" href="ch05s08.html#osivv" title="Open Source IV&amp;V">Open Source IV&amp;V</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="xref" href="ch05s08.html#lawyers-no-surprises" title="Don't Surprise Your Lawyers">Don't Surprise Your Lawyers</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="xref" href="ch05s10.html#lock-in-vs-freedom" title="Open Source and Freedom from Vendor Lock-In">Open Source and Freedom from Vendor Lock-In</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="xref" href="ch05s11.html#dispel-myths" title="Dispel Myths Within Your Organization">Dispel Myths Within Your Organization</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="xref" href="ch05s11.html#publicity-events-vs-project-events" title="Don't Let Publicity Events Drive Project Schedule">Don't Let Publicity Events Drive Project Schedule</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="xref" href="ch05s11.html#middle-management" title="The Key Role of Middle Management">The Key Role of Middle Management</a></li></ul></div><p>In addition to the above sections in this book, there are many
excellent online resources for doing open source in government.  I
won't even try to include a complete list, as there is too much and it
changes too quickly.  Here are a few sites that are likely to remain
good starting points for some time to come, especially for government
agencies in the United States and in countries with procurement and
civil service systems similar to those of the U.S.</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="https://18f.gsa.gov/">https://18f.gsa.gov/</a> is a digital services agency within the United
  States federal government, created in 2014 to bring modern software
  development practices to government work.  18F serves as a
  technology consultancy to other agencies, and builds its
  deliverables out in the open as open source software.  Along the
  way, 18F has generated useful guidelines and observations that anyone
  trying to run an open source software project within government can
  benefit from.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://mil-oss.org/">http://mil-oss.org/</a> is an association of civilian and military open
  source software and hardware developers in the U.S, but the advice
  and resources they've put together broadly applicable to open source
  in government generally, not just to military projects.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/">http://www.dwheeler.com/</a>, the home site of Dr. David A. Wheeler, is a
  fantastic trove that includes, among many other open-source-related
  things, tons of information about how to use U.S. government
  procurement regulations to support open source development.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="ulink" href="http://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/">http://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/</a> is a terrific
  post to mine for arguments, if you are advocating for open source
  development within a government agency.  Many of Ben Balter's other
  writings are worth looking at too.</p></li></ul></div><p>Finally, there is one issue in particular that I have
encountered over and over again in government-initiated open source
projects.  It is so common, and so potentially damaging to a project,
that I have given it its own subsection below.</p><div class="sect2" title="Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="starting-open-for-govs"/>Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for
Government Projects</h2></div></div></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#be-open-from-day-one" title="Be Open From Day One">the section called “Be Open From Day One”</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started</em></a></span>, I
explained why it's best for an open source project to be run in the
open from the very beginning.  That advice, particularly <a class="xref" href="ch02s03.html#avoid-exposure-events" title="Waiting Just Creates an Exposure Event">the section called “Waiting Just Creates an Exposure Event”</a>, is if anything even more true for
government code.</p><p>Government projects have greater potential to be harmed by a
needless exposure event than private-sector projects have.  Elected
officials and those who work for them are understandably sensitive to
negative public comments.  Thus even for the most conscientious team,
a worrying cloud of uncertainty will surround everything by the time
you're ready to open up hitherto closed code.  How can you ever know
you've got it all cleaned up?  You do your best, but you can never be
totally sure some hawk-eyed hacker out there won't spot something
embarrassing after the release.  The team worries, and worry is an
energy drain: it causes them to spend time chasing down ghosts, and at
the same time can cause them to unconsciously avoid steps that might
risk revealing real problems.</p><p>This concern doesn't only apply to government software, of
course.  But in the private sector, businesses sometimes have
competitive reasons to stay behind the curtain until their first
release, even if they intend for the project to be open source in the
long run.  Government projects should not have that motivation to
start out closed, at least in theory, and they have even more to
lose.</p></div></div></body></html>
