the organization and integration of human-language translation work in
open source projects.  "Translation work" here means not just the
process of translating the software's documentation, but also its
run-time user interface, error messages, etc into different languages,
so that each user can interact with the software in their preferred
language.  (See <a class="xref" href="share-management.html#translation-manager" title="Translation Manager">the section called &#8220;Translation Manager&#8221;</a>
for more about the translation process.)</p><p>It is not strictly necessary to use a separate translation
platform at all.  Your translators could work directly in the
project's repository, like any other developer.  But because
translation is a specialized skill, and translators' methods are
basically the same from project to project, the process is quite
amenable to being made more efficient through the use of dedicated
tools.  Web-based translation platforms make it easier for translators
to get involved because such platforms remove the requirement that a
translator (who may have linguistic expertise but not development
expertise) be comfortable with the project's development tools, and
because they are specially optimized for performing translation rather
than for performing general code development.</p><p>Until 2013, the obvious recommendation for a platform would have
been <a class="ulink" href="https://transifex.com/" target="_top">https://transifex.com/</a>, which
was both the premier software translation site and was open source
software itself.  Transifex is probably still the premier platform in
terms of usage, including among open source projects, but its main
corporate sponsors forked it into a closed, proprietary version in
March 2013<sup>[<a name="idp1670" href="#ftn.idp1670" class="footnote">42</a>]</sup>.  Transifex still offers free hosting for
open source projects, but if you prefer that your translators have a
fully open source platform to work in, <a class="ulink" href="https://weblate.org/" target="_top">https://weblate.org/</a> is one, and it offers
a commercial hosted service that is free of charge for open source
projects as well.  Three other open source platforms are Launchpad
Translations <a class="ulink" href="https://translations.launchpad.net/" target="_top">https://translations.launchpad.net/</a>, <a class="ulink" href="http://zanata.org/" target="_top">http://zanata.org/</a>, and <a class="ulink" href="https://translatewiki.net/" target="_top">https://translatewiki.net/</a>.</p><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp1670" href="#idp1670" class="para">42</a>] </sup>See <a class="ulink" href="https://github.com/transifex/transifex/issues/206#issuecomment-15243207" target="_top">https://github.com/transifex/transifex/issues/206#issuecomment-15243207</a>
