choosing a license.  Read <a class="xref" href="legal.html" title="9. fejezet - Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">9. fejezet - <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a> to understand
the detailed legal implications of the different licenses, and how the
license you choose can affect people's ability to mix your software
with other free software.</p><p>There are a great many free software licenses to choose from.
Most of them we needn't consider here, as they were written to satisfy
the particular legal needs of some corporation or person, and wouldn't
be appropriate for your project.  We will restrict ourselves to just
the most commonly used licenses; in most cases, you will want to
choose one of them.</p><div class="sect2" title='The "Do Anything" Licenses'><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="license-quickstart-non-gpl"></a>The "Do Anything" Licenses</h3></div></div></div><p>If you're comfortable with your project's code potentially being
used in proprietary programs, then use
an <em class="firstterm">MIT/X-style</em> license.  It is the simplest of
several minimal licenses that do little more than assert nominal
copyright (without actually restricting copying) and specify that the
code comes with no warranty.  See
<a class="xref" href="license-choosing.html#license-choosing-mit-x" title="The MIT / X Window System License">&#8222;The MIT / X Window System License&#8221;</a> for details.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="The GPL"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="license-quickstart-gpl"></a>The GPL</h3></div></div></div><p>If you don't want your code to be used in proprietary programs,
use the GNU General Public License
(<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html</a>).  The GPL is
probably the most widely recognized free software license in the world
today.  This is in itself a big advantage, since many potential users
and contributors will already be familiar with it, and therefore won't
have to spend extra time to read and understand your license.  See
<a class="xref" href="license-choosing.html#license-choosing-gpl" title="The GNU General Public License">&#8222;The GNU General Public License&#8221;</a><span>
in <a class="xref" href="legal.html" title="9. fejezet - Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents">9. fejezet - <i>Licenses, Copyrights, and Patents</i></a></span> for details.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="How to Apply a License to Your Software"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="license-quickstart-applying"></a>How to Apply a License to Your Software</h3></div></div></div><p>Once you've chosen a license, you should state it on the
project's front page.  You don't need to include the actual text of
the license there; just give the name of the license, and make it link
to the full license text on another page.</p><p>This tells the public what license you
<span class="emphasis"><em>intend</em></span> the software to be released under, but
it's not sufficient for legal purposes.  For that, the software itself
must contain the license.  The standard way to do this is to put the
full license text in a file called <code class="filename">COPYING</code> (or
<code class="filename">LICENSE</code>), and then put a short notice at the top
of each source file, naming the copyright date, holder, and license,
and saying where to find the full text of the license.</p><p>There are many variations on this pattern, so we'll look at just
one example here.  The GNU GPL says to put a notice like this at the
top of each source file:</p><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>It does not say specifically that the copy of the license you
received along with the program is in the file
<code class="filename">COPYING</code>, but that's where it's usually put.  (You
could change the above notice to state that directly.)  This template
also gives a geographical address from which to request a copy of the
license.  Another common method is to give a link to a web page
containing the license.  Just use your judgement and point to wherever
you feel the most permanent copy of the license is maintained, which
might simply be somewhere on your project's web site.  In general, the
notice you put in each source file does not have to look exactly like
the one above, as long as it starts with the same notice of copyright
holder and date, states the name of the license, and makes it clear
where to view the full license.</p></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="getting-started.html">Vissza</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="getting-started.html">Fel</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="setting-tone.html">El&#337;re</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">2. fejezet - Getting Started </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">F&#337;oldal</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Setting the Tone</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
