first edition of this book was published, it's become clear to me that
there are special concerns that apply to organizations launching or 
participating in open source projects.  Organizations contain formal
management structures and informal social structures: both are
affected by engagement with open source projects, and both sometimes
need to be changed to better support open source activity by the
individuals within the organization.  In particular, government
agencies have special pitfalls to watch out for when working with open
source projects.</p><p>This section therefore examines organizational issues generally,
and some issues specific to government agencies, and offers some
advice about how to make organizational engagement with open source
more likely to succeed.  Many of these recommendations will be brief
and somewhat generalized, not because there isn't more depth to go
into, but because the specifics can vary so much from organization to
organization that exploring all the possibilities here would require
too much space.  Please treat these bits of advice as starting points,
not as complete recipes in themselves.</p><div class="sect2" title="Dispel Myths Within Your Organization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="myths-to-dispel"></a>Dispel Myths Within Your Organization</h3></div></div></div><p>In organizations that have been producing or using proprietary
software for a long time, certain myths about open source software
sometimes circulate.  One traditional source of such myths is, of
course, sales representatives from vendors of proprietary systems.
But one can't attribute it all to them.  It's just as often the case
that someone had some bad experiences in an open source project, or
used open source in the past without ensuring proper support channels,
and since that was their first experience in an unfamiliar territory,
the entire territory is now tainted.</p><p>Here are some of the myths I've encountered most frequently:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>If it's open, that means anyone can
   change our code.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Believe it or not, you need to be prepared to respond to
     this.  Sometimes people &#8212; particularly senior
     decision-makers who have limited technical
     experience &#8212; don't understand the difference
     between an upstream code base allowing anyone to make and modify
     copies, and someone modifying the <span class="emphasis"><em>particular copy you
     deployed</em></span>.  The former is just the definition of open
     source, of course; the latter would be a security vulnerability
     if it happened, but it has nothing to do with the license on the
     code.  I mention this myth merely to prepare you for encountering
     it, because otherwise you might not expect that anyone could hold
     this particular misunderstanding.  Trust me, they
     <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span>, and you need to be ready to answer
     it.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Open source software is insecure,
   because anyone can change the code.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This is so easy to answer that I won't give a detailed
     refutation here; again, I merely note it so you can be prepared
     for it.  If you find yourself having to explain why open source
     software is at least as secure as any other kind of software, if
     not more secure, you may wish to use the excellent resources
     provided by Dr. David A. Wheeler at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/#oss" target="_top">dwheeler.com/#oss</a>,
     and the arguments at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.mil-oss.org/learn-more/security-model-misconceptions" target="_top">mil-oss.org/learn-more/security-model-misconceptions</a>.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Open source comes with no
   support.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>There are plenty of companies that sell support for open
     source software, and they're not hard to find.  There are also
     wonderfully helpful unofficial support communities on the
     Internet for different open source packages, of course, but often
     what organizations are looking for is a phone number to call, or
     a support chat room, that has a guaranteed response time.  These
     are available, it's just that the source from which you
     procure the software may be unrelated to the source from which
     you procure the support.  The best way to respond to this myth is
     to ask specifically for what packages support is desired, and
     then show some sources of support available for
     them.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Open source is cheaper.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Licensing costs are often not the largest cost with
     proprietary software; they are often outweight by training costs,
     installation and configuration costs, and other factors that make
     up the "total cost of ownership".  But all of those other costs
     are, on average, the same for open source software.  Don't make
     the mistake of pitching your organization on open source software
     on the grounds that it is cheaper.  At least in terms of the most
     easily quantified costs, it is not.  It is often cheaper in the
     long run, because it frees your organization from proprietary
     vendor lock-in, reduces training costs for new employees (because
     they arrive already familiar with the software), gives you
     greater ability to customize software to your needs, etc.  But
     these are long-term benefits that may not even show up directly
     on a balance sheet unless you take steps to make your accounting
     reveal them.  In the short term, open source generally isn't
     cheaper than proprietary software, and shouldn't be sold that
     way.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>If we open source this project, we'll
   have to spend a lot of time interacting with outside
   developers.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>You open source your code, not your time.  You are never
     under any obligation to respond at all to outside parties, let
     alone engage substantively with them.  You should only do so when
     engaging will benefit
     <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span> &#8212; which it often will;
     after all, one of the key strengths of open source is that it
     enlarges the collective brain of your development team in direct
     proportion to how much they interact with other developers who
     become interested in the code.  But that engagement is always
     under your control and at your discretion.  If you don't want
     your team's attention going to bug reports or development
     questions from the outside, that's fine.  Just be up front about
     that in the project's documentation, so that others can take that
     into account before they put a lot of energy into trying to
     communicate with your developers, and so they can decide whether
     forking to create a more open community would make sense for them
     (indeed, sometimes it might even be to your advantage for them to
     do that).</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>If we open source this project, then
   we'll have to release all our other stuff as open source
   too.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>This myth usually results from a misunderstanding of
       copyleft licenses and the GNU General Public License (GPL) in
       particular.  I won't go into detail here; see <a class="xref" href="legal.html" title="Chapter 9. Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents">Chapter 9, <i>Legal Matters: Licenses, Copyrights, Trademarks and Patents</i></a> for a discussion of what the GPL actually
       stipulates.  After reading that chapter, especially
       <a class="xref" href="license-choosing.html#copyright-holder-is-special" title="The Copyright Holder Is Special, Even In Copyleft Licenses">the section called &#8220;The Copyright Holder Is Special, Even In Copyleft Licenses&#8221;</a>, you will be able
       to explain why this belief is incorrect.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Developers will devote attention to
   this code just because we released it.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>People with little experience in open source sometimes
     assume that the mere act of releasing code to the public will
     result in a flurry of attention from other
     developers &#8212; questions, patches, high-quality
     code review, bug reports, etc.  But what actually happens, in
     most cases, is silence.  Most good developers are busy people,
     and they're not going to pay attention to your project until they
     have some reason to.  If your code is good and solves a real
     problem, you can expect word to travel to the right places
     eventually, and of course you can help that word along with
     tactically smart announcements and posts (see <a class="xref" href="publicity.html" title="Publicity">the section called &#8220;Publicity&#8221;</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="communications.html" title="Chapter 6. Communications">Chapter 6, <i>Communications</i></a></span>).  But until your code has
     had time to naturally accumulate credibility and mindshare, most
     people won't pay any attention, so you shouldn't expect that
     first release to be a big deal for anyone but you.</p><p>There is a situation in which this myth is not a myth.  A
     large organization with a reputation and a dedicated public
     relations team <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> create buzz around an
     initial open source release.  If you do this, then make sure not
     to squander that buzz: be ready to constructively engage the
     developer attention you attract right away.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Other companies / cities / whatever
   will pick up this software and start using it right
   away.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Adopting any software involves costs.  Indeed, merely
     <span class="emphasis"><em>evaluating</em></span> software involves costs.  So when
     you release a new open source project that you and your team are
     excited about, that doesn't necessarily mean other entities are
     going to pick it up right away and run with it.  Many of them may
     notice it, if you've done your announcement process well, but
     but that just means they'll put it on their list of things to
     investigate based on organization-wide
     priorities &#8212; in other words, they'll take a
     closer look based on <span class="emphasis"><em>their</em></span> schedule, not
     yours.  So don't expect a flood of early adopters.  You may get a
     few, and they should definitely be cultivated because they will
     provide the word-of-mouth that gets you more adopters.  But in
     general you're more likely to see a trickle of early adopters
     over the first year or so after your initial release, than to see
     a flood of them immediately when the release is
     made.</p></dd></dl></div></div><div class="sect2" title="Foster Pools of Expertise in Multiple Places"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="foster-expertise-diversity"></a>Foster Pools of Expertise in Multiple Places</h3></div></div></div><p>Sometimes organizations that are accustomed to procuring
proprietary software treat open source software as if it were
proprietary, in the sense that they assume there is ultimately exatcly
one authoritative source of expert support, and that it is therefore
necessary to have a commercial relationship with that source.</p><p>That's not how open source works.  One of the great strengths of
open source is the availability of support from multiple, competing
providers.  It's perfectly fine, and often advisable, to have a
commercial relationship with just one of those sources, but you must
remember that support in open source is fundamentally a
<span class="emphasis"><em>marketplace</em></span>, not an add-on feature that just
happens to come with the software license, as is often the case with
proprietary software.  Actually, even proprietary software sometimes
has a competitive support marketplace &#8212; think for
example of the third-party support providers for Oracle databases and
Microsoft operating systems &#8212; but in open source these
marketplaces tend to be more fluid and not as dominated by single,
easily-recognizeable giants, because there isn't necessarily one
commercial outfit that can automatically assume a place at the top of
the hierarchy to sell gold-label support (e.g., as Oracle or Microsoft
themselves would be, in the example just given).</p><p>Ideally, the goal of fostering independent pools of expertise
should even affect how you structure contracts to develop the software
in the first place.  If you hire a firm to develop new open source
software, have a few of your own programmers working alongside them if
possible, so that you accumulate some in-house expertise.  This is not
necessarily because you won't want to use the same firm for future
maintenance &#8212; they might be a great
choice &#8212; but just so that you'll have a better
bargaining position and not be locked in.  The more people
<span class="emphasis"><em>in different organizations</em></span> who know the code, the
better position that code is in, and the better position you are in.
This is also one of the side benefits of holding hackathons as
discussed in <a class="ulink" href="fund-meetings" target="_top">fund-meetings</a>.</p><p>If your organization does not have enough in-house technical
ability to participate in the development process directly alongside
your contractor, or at least to perform knowledgeable review, then I
strongly recommend finding a third-party to provide
<span class="emphasis"><em>independent</em></span> deployability and maintainability
review while the project is under way, as described in
<a class="xref" href="contracting.html#third-party-review" title="Get Third-Party Review During Development">the section called &#8220;Get Third-Party Review During Development&#8221;</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Don't Let Publicity Events Drive Project Schedule"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="publicity-events-vs-project-events"></a>Don't Let Publicity Events Drive Project Schedule</h3></div></div></div><p>Although open source projects are amenable to software project
management techniques, in general if you have an active developer
community you do lose some control over the exact timing of events in
the life of the project, especially the scheduling of releases.  Or
rather, you can still have as much control as you want, but now there
are other things you can lose if you exercise that control
in the wrong way.  For example, if the release manager (see <a class="xref" href="stabilizing-a-release.html#release-manager" title="Release manager">the section called &#8220;Release manager&#8221;</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="development-cycle.html" title="Chapter 7. Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development">Chapter 7, <i>Packaging, Releasing, and Daily Development</i></a></span>) is someone from outside your
organization, and she's doing a good job, then if you try to force the
release to be on a certain precise date, you may cause her and many of
the developers participating in release-specific work to give up and
devote their attention to something else.  You'd gain fine-grained
control of the release schedule, but at the cost of lower quality
releases and the possible loss of some of your development
community.</p><p>This is just one example illustrating the general principle that
if you have publicity needs related to an open source project, you
shouldn't let those needs drive the project's schedule.  If you
arrange a press conference for the project reaching 1.0 and being
deployed live, but then the developers decide on an extra two weeks of
testing because of some last-minute bugs, you'll have some improvising
to do.  (This example is drawn from real life, by the way.)</p><p>There are two ways to achieve this independence, and they are
not mutually exclusive.  One way is to just let project events drive
publicity instead of the other way around, such as by preparing
release announcements ahead of time but being ready to publish them
based on when the release is actually done.  The other way is to
create publicity events that are not bound to development milestones,
but are rather associated with project-related things that
<span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> able to be scheduled relatively precisely,
such as conference appearances, hackathons, major deployments,
etc.</p><p>You might be tempted to try a third way: to bring the
development community into the scheduling process, so that through
consensus you are able schedule certain milestones accurately enough
to tie timed publicity to them.  While that may sound like a good
idea, in practice it rarely works.  An open source development
community's first priority is the software itself, and making sure it
meets the needs its participants are working toward.  Of course the
community wants releases and other deadlines to be met with reasonable
regularity, and every development community makes tradeoffs to achieve
that regularity.  But even with the best of intentions among all
parties, you can never guarantee how that tradeoff will be decided in
a particular case, when things get down to the wire.  The outcome of a
community's decision-making process cannot be anticipated with perfect
accuracy, by definition &#8212; if it could, there would be
no need for a decision-making process.  So while it's fine to try to
influence the community's decisions in ways that work to your
advantage, you should avoid relying on that for scheduling purposes,
because you won't succeed at it every time.</p></div><div class="sect2" title="Establish Contact Early with Relevant External Communities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="talk-to-relevant-communities-early"></a>Establish Contact Early with Relevant External Communities</h3></div></div></div><p>poss2: pre-announce; ask for help not admiration; use contracts

Open source policies vs open data policies.</em></span></p><p>This section is mainly about government agencies producing new
open source software, and participating in existing open source
projects; I'll also look at government usage of open source software,
to the extent that it overlaps with those main topics.</p><p>Since the first edition of this book in 2005, I've worked with
various U.S. government agencies, at the federal, state, and municipal
levels, to help them release open source software.  I've also been
lucky enough to observe, and in a few cases work with, some government
agencies outside the U.S.  These experiences have convinced me of one
thing: government is different.  If you work at a government agency
and the material in this book so far has made you shake your head and
think "Sure, but it'll never work here", you have my sympathy
 &#8212; I know exactly what you mean.  Governments differ
from individuals and from private-sector organizations in some
fundamental ways:

</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc"><li class="listitem">Governments often aren't trying to retain technical
  expertise in-house (that's what contractors are for).</li><li class="listitem">Governments have labyrinthine and in certain ways
  inflexible procurement and employment policies.  These policies can
  make it difficult for a government agency to be nimbly responsive in
  an open source development community.</li><li class="listitem">Government agencies tend to be unusually risk-averse.
  Somewhere at the top there's an elected official who, reasonably,
  sees an open source project as just one more surface area for
  opponents to attack.  After all, when development happens in public,
  the inevitable false starts and wrong turns are also public; if
  development were internal, no one else would know about it when
  those things happen.</li><li class="listitem">Government officials hunger for well-timed and
  well-controlled publicity events.  This has certain benefits, but it
  can sometimes come at the expense of overall project health.
  This need for publicity is the complement of being risk-averse:
  elected officials and those who work for them understand that most
  people aren't paying much attention most of the
  time &#8212; therefore, those who work in government want
  to ensure that in the few moments when people
  <span class="emphasis"><em>are</em></span> paying attention, they see something
  good.  This is understandable, but it can cause them to delay
  certain actions &#8212; or, in some cases, do them too
  soon &#8212; based on external publicity implications
  rather than on what's best for the project technically and
  socially.</li></ul></div><p>

</p><p>There are good reasons for all of these things; they've been
true for decades if not centuries, and they're not going to change.
So if you're a government agency and you want to start a successful
open source project, certain adjustments will be necessary to
compensate for the structural idiosyncracies mentioned above.  The
advice that follows is most applicable to the U.S. and countries with similar
systems of government and civil service.</p><div class="sect3" title="Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for Government Projects"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="starting-open-for-govs"></a>Being Open Source From Day One is Especially Important for
Government Projects</h4></div></div></div><p>In <a class="xref" href="setting-tone.html#be-open-from-day-one" title="Be Open From Day One">the section called &#8220;Be Open From Day One&#8221;</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <i>Getting Started</i></a></span>, I
explained why it's best for an open source project to be run in the
open from the very beginning.  That advice, particularly <a class="xref" href="setting-tone.html#avoid-exposure-events" title="Waiting Just Creates an Exposure Event">the section called &#8220;Waiting Just Creates an Exposure Event&#8221;</a>, is if anything even more true for
government code.</p><p>Government projects have greater potential to be harmed by a
needless exposure event than private-sector projects have.  Elected
officials and those who work for them are understandably sensitive to
negative public comments.  Thus even for the most conscientious team,
a worrying cloud of uncertainty will surround everything by the time
you're ready to open up hitherto closed code.  How can you ever know
you've got it all cleaned up?  You do your best, but you can never be
totally sure some hawk-eyed hacker out there won't spot something
embarrassing after the release.  The team worries, and worry is an
energy drain: it causes them to spend time chasing down ghosts, and at
the same time can cause them to unconsciously avoid steps that might
risk revealing real problems.</p><p>This concern doesn't only apply to government software, of
course.  But in the private sector, businesses sometimes have
competitive reasons to stay behind the curtain until their first
release, even if they intend for the project to be open source in the
long run.  Government projects should not have that motivation to
start out closed, at least in theory, and they have even more to
lose.</p></div></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="marketing.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="money.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="hiring.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Marketing </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Hiring Open Source Developers</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
