developers, encourage new contributors to become more deeply involved,
allow free-flowing discussion while still reaching necessary
decisions, maintain a body of knowledge and convention that guides
newcomers and experts alike, and, of course, produce working
software.</p><p>Coordinate people to accomplish all this together requires many
techniques, and because open source collaboration is ultimately based
on software code, most of those techniques revolve around the written
word.  We'll start there.</p></div><div class="sect1" title="Written Culture"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="written-culture"></a>Written Culture</h2></div></div></div><p>The ability to write clearly is perhaps the most important skill
one can have in an open source environment.  In the long run it
matters more than programming talent.  A great programmer with lousy
communications skills can get only one thing done at a time, and even
then may have trouble convincing others to pay attention.  But a lousy
programmer with good communications skills can coordinate and persuade
many people to do many different things, and thereby have a
significant effect on a project's direction and momentum.</p><p>There does not seem to be much correlation, in either direction,
between the ability to write good code and the ability to communicate
with one's fellow human beings.  There is some correlation between
programming well and describing technical issues well, but describing
technical issues is only a tiny part of the communications in a
project.  Much more important is the ability to empathize with one's
audience, to see one's own posts and comments as others see them, and
to cause others to see their own posts with similar objectivity.
Equally important is noticing when a given medium or communications
method is no longer working well, perhaps because it doesn't scale as
the number of users increases, and taking the time to do something
about it.</p><p>All of which is obvious in theory &#8212; what makes it hard in
practice is that free software development environments are
bewilderingly diverse both in audiences and in communications
mechanisms.  Should a given thought be expressed in a post to the
mailing list, as an annotation in the bug tracker, or as a comment
in the code?  When answering a question in a public forum, how much
knowledge can you assume on the part of the reader, given that "the
reader" is not only the one who asked the question in the first place,
but all those who might see your response?  How can the developers
stay in constructive contact with the users, without getting swamped
by feature requests, spurious bug reports, and general chatter?  How
do you tell when a medium has reached the limits of its capacity, and
what do you do about it?</p><p>Solutions to these problems are usually partial, because any
particular solution is eventually made obsolete by project growth or
changes in project structure.  They are also often <span class="foreignphrase"><em class="foreignphrase">ad
hoc</em></span>, because they're improvised responses to dynamic
situations.  All participants need to be aware of when and how
communications can become bogged down, and be involved in
solutions.  Helping people do this is a big part of managing an open
source project.</p><p>The sections that follow discuss both how to conduct
your own communications, and how to make maintenance of communications
mechanisms a priority for everyone in the project.<sup>[<a name="idp2492" href="#ftn.idp2492" class="footnote">66</a>]</sup></p></div><div class="footnotes"><br><hr width="100" align="left"><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp2492" href="#idp2492" class="para">66</a>] </sup>There
