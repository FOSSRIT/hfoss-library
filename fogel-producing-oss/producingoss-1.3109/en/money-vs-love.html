early on about what the money can and cannot buy.  This does not mean
you need to post twice a day to the mailing lists reiterating your
noble and incorruptible nature.  It merely means that you should be on
the lookout for opportunities to defuse the tensions that
<span class="emphasis"><em>could</em></span> be created by money.  You don't need to
start out assuming that the tensions are there; you do need to
demonstrate an awareness that they have the potential to arise.</p><p>A perfect example of this came up early in the Subversion project.
Subversion was started in 2000 by CollabNet (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.collab.net/" target="_top">http://www.collab.net/</a>), which has been the
project's primary funder since its inception, paying the salaries of
several developers (disclosure: I was one of them for six years).  Soon after the
project began, we hired another developer, Mike Pilato, to join the
effort.  By then, coding had already started.  Although Subversion was
still very much in the early stages, it already had a development
community with a set of basic ground rules.</p><p>Mike's arrival raised an interesting question.  Subversion
already had a policy about how a new developer gets commit access.
First, he submits some patches to the development mailing list.  After
enough patches have gone by for the other committers to see that the
new contributor knows what he's doing, someone proposes that he just
commit directly (that proposal is private, as described in <a class="xref" href="committers.html" title="Committers">the section called &#8220;Committers&#8221;</a>).  Assuming the
committers agree, one of them mails the new developer and offers him
direct commit access to the project's repository.</p><p>CollabNet had hired Mike specifically to work on Subversion.
Among those who already knew him, there was no doubt about his coding
skills or his readiness to work on the project.  Furthermore, the
other developers had a very good relationship with the CollabNet
employees, and most likely would not have objected if we'd just given
Mike commit access the day he was hired.  But we knew we'd be setting
a precedent.  If we granted Mike commit access by fiat, we'd be saying
that CollabNet had the right to ignore project guidelines, simply
because it was the primary funder.  While the damage from this would
not necessarily be immediately apparent, it would gradually result in
the non-salaried developers feeling disenfranchised.  Other people
have to earn their commit access &#8212; CollabNet just buys
it.</p><p>So Mike agreed to start out his employment at CollabNet like any
other new developer, without commit access.  He sent patches to
the public mailing list, where they could be, and were, reviewed by
everyone.  We also said on the list that we were doing things this way
deliberately, so there could be no missing the point.  After a couple
of weeks of solid activity by Mike, someone (I can't remember if it
was a CollabNet developer or not) proposed him for commit access, and
he was accepted, as we knew he would be.</p><p>That kind of consistency gets you a credibility that money could
never buy.  And credibility is a valuable currency to have in
technical discussions: it's immunization against having one's motives
questioned later.  In the heat of argument, people will sometimes look
for non-technical ways to win the battle.  The project's primary
funder, because of its deep involvement and obvious concern over the
directions the project takes, presents a wider target than most.  By
being scrupulous to observe all project guidelines right from the
start, the funder makes itself the same size as everyone else.</p><p>(See also Danese Cooper's blog post, preserved in the Internet

for a similar story about commit access.  Cooper was then Sun
Microsystem's "Open Source Diva" &#8212; I believe that was her official
title &#8212; and in the blog entry, she describes how the Tomcat
development community got Sun to hold its own developers to the same
commit-access standards as the non-Sun developers.)</p><p>The need for the funders to play by the same rules as everyone
else means that the Benevolent Dictatorship governance model (see
<a class="xref" href="benevolent-dictator.html" title="Benevolent Dictators">the section called &#8220;Benevolent Dictators&#8221;</a>) is slightly
harder to pull
off in the presence of funding, particularly if the dictator works for
the primary funder.  Since a dictatorship has few rules, it is hard
for the funder to prove that it's abiding by community standards, even
when it is.  It's certainly not impossible; it just requires a project
leader who is able to see things from the point of view of the outside
developers, as well as that of the funder, and act accordingly.  Even
then, it's probably a good idea to have a proposal for non-dictatorial
governance sitting in your back pocket, ready to be brought out if
there start to be indications of widespread dissatisfaction in the
community.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="open-motives.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="money.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="contracting.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Be Open About Your Motivations </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Contracting</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
