presentable—you're ready to announce it to the world.</p><p>This is a simpler process than you might expect.  There are two kinds
of forums for making announcements: generic forums that display a
constant stream of new project announcements, and topic-specific
forums where your project would be appropriate news.</p><p>The most useful generic place is probably <a class="ulink" href="http://freecode.com/">freecode.com</a> — just click on the
<span class="guimenuitem">Submit new project</span> link in the top
navigation bar.  Freecode's list of recent new projects is embedded on
the front page of the popular <a class="ulink" href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot.org</a>, which means someone interested is likely to
notice it and help spread the news by word of mouth.  (Note that
Freecode was known as Freshmeat.net until it was renamed in Oct 2011.)
You might also want to register your project at <a class="ulink" href="http://OhLoh.net/">OhLoh.net</a>, which is the closest thing
there is to an integrated global database of free software projects
and their contributors.  (Some projects also successfully climb the
word-of-mouth / upvote tree to the point where they are featured on
the front page of <a class="ulink" href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">news.ycombinator.com</a>, one of the subreddit forums related to
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/">reddit.com/r/technology</a>, or some similarly popular public
page.  While it's good news for your project if you can get mentioned
in a place like that, I hesitate to contribute to the marketing arms
race by suggesting any concrete steps to accomplish this.  Use your
judgement and try not to spam.)</p><p>The topic-specific forums are probably where you'll get the most
interest.  Think about mailing lists or web frums where an
announcement of your project would be on-topic and of
interest — you might already be a member of some of
them — and post there.  Be careful to make exactly
<span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> post per forum, and to direct people to your
project's own discussion areas for follow-up discussion (when posting
by email, you can do this by setting the
<code class="systemitem">Reply-to</code> header).  Your announcement should
be short and get right to the point, and the Subject line should make
it clear that it is an announcement of a new project:</p><pre class="screen">
To: discuss@some.forum.about.search.indexers
Subject: [ANN] Scanley, a new full-text indexer project.
Reply-to: dev@scanley.org

This is a one-time post to announce the creation of the Scanley
project, an open source full-text indexer and search engine with a
rich API, for use by programmers in providing search services for
large collections of text files.  Scanley is now running code, is
under active development, and is looking for both developers and
testers.

Home page: http://www.scanley.org/

Features:
   - Searches plain text, HTML, and XML
   - Word or phrase searching
   - (planned) Fuzzy matching
   - (planned) Incremental updating of indexes
   - (planned) Indexing of remote web sites
   - (planned) Long-distance mind-reading

Requirements:
   - Python 3.2 or higher
   - SQLite 3.8.1 or higher

For more information, please come find us at scanley.org!

Thank you,

<a class="xref" href="ch06.html" title="6장. Communications">6장. <em>Communications</em></a></span> for advice on announcing
subsequent releases and other project events.)</p><p>There is an ongoing debate in the free software world about
whether it is necessary to begin with running code, or whether a
project can benefit from being announced even during the
design/discussion stage.  I used to think starting with running code
was crucial, that it was what separated successful projects from toys,
and that serious developers would only be attracted to software that
already does something concrete.</p><p>This turned out not to be the case.  In the Subversion project,
we started with a design document, a core of interested and
well-connected developers, a lot of fanfare, and
<span class="emphasis"><em>no</em></span> running code at all.  To my complete surprise,
the project acquired active participants right from the beginning, and
by the time we did have something running, there were quite a few
volunteer developers already deeply involved.  Subversion is not the
only example; the Mozilla project was also launched without running
code, and is now a successful and popular web browser.</p><p>On the evidence of this and other examples, I have to back away
from the assertion that running code is absolutely necessary for
launching a project.  Running code is still the best foundation for
success, and a good rule of thumb would be to wait until you have it
before announcing your project<sup>[<a id="idp5417792" href="#ftn.idp5417792" class="footnote">24</a>]</sup>.  However, there may be circumstances where
announcing earlier makes sense.  I do think that at least a
well-developed design document, or else some sort of code framework,
is necessary—of course it may be revised based on public
feedback, but there has to be something concrete, something more
tangible than just good intentions, for people to sink their teeth
into.</p><p>Whenever you announce, don't expect a horde of volunteers to
join the project immediately afterward.  Usually, the result of
announcing is that you get a few casual inquiries, a few more people
join your mailing lists, and aside from that, everything continues
pretty much as before.  But over time, you will notice a gradual
increase in participation from both new code contributors and users.
Announcement is merely the planting of a seed.  It can take a long
time for the news to spread.  If the project consistently rewards
those who get involved, the news <span class="emphasis"><em>will</em></span> spread,
though, because people want to share when they've found something
good.  If all goes well, the dynamics of exponential communications
networks will slowly transform the project into a complex community,
where you don't necessarily know everyone's name and can no longer
follow every single conversation.  The next chapters are about working
in that environment.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idp5417792" href="#idp5417792" class="para">24</a>] </sup>Note that
<span class="emphasis"><em>announcing</em></span> your project can come long after you
have open sourced the code.  My advice to consider carefully the
timing of your announcement should not be taken as advice to delay
open sourcing the code — ideally, your project should
be open source and publicly visible from the very first moment of its
existence, and this is entirely independent of when you announce it.
