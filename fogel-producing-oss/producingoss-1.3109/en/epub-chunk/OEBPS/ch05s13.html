open source projects, that topic is inextricably linked to the problem
of evaluating existing open source projects.  You can't know whether
you need to start a new one until you've evaluated what's out there
(as explained in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#look-around" title="But First, Look Around">the section called “But First, Look Around”</a><span> in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started</em></a></span>).  Furthermore, even
in a new project, you'll usually still be building on existing open
source components, and will often be in the position of choosing
between different projects that implement the same basic
functionality.  That is not just a technical choice; it's also about
social health and general level of project maturity.  How large and
diverse are their developer communities?  Do they get new contributors
on a regular basis?  Do they handle incoming bug reports in a
reasonable way?  Do they make stable releases frequently enough for
your needs?  And so on.</p><p>Evaluating open source projects is certainly an art, not a
science.  However, there are some shortcuts that experienced people
use.  Below is what has worked for me, and by "worked", I mean that
when I have applied these evaluation techniques to a project and then
checked in with that project months or years later, I have generally
found that its current circumstances are in line with what the
evaluation predicted.</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Look at bug tracker activity first.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>The most reliable signals of project health can usually be
     found in the bug tracker.  Look at the rate of issue filings and
     the number of unique filers (because that's a proxy for the size
     and level of engagement of the user base), and look at how often
     project developers respond in bug tickets — and
     at <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span> they respond: are they constructive?
     Do they interact well with both the reporter and with other
     developers?  Is it always the same developer responding, or is
     responsiveness well-distributed throughout the development team?
     More bug reports is better, by the way, as discussed in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#vc-and-bug-tracker-access" title="Version Control and Bug Tracker Access">the section called “Version Control and Bug Tracker Access”</a><span>
     in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Getting Started">Chapter 2, <em>Getting Started</em></a></span>.  The rate at which
     bug reports are <span class="emphasis"><em>closed</em></span> is not as important
     as you might think; in a healthy project with an active user
     base, bug reports will probably be filed faster than the
     development team can close them.  The important question is not
     rate of resolution, but how the project responds to and organizes
     the influx of reports.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Measure commit diversity, not commit rate.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Look at the distribution of commits across committers, not
     just at the raw frequency of commits.  Does the project have a
     variety of people working together in a sustained way?  Too often,
     evaluators look just at the commit rate, but the rate isn't very
     informative — knowing the number of commits per
     week doesn't tell you anything except that (perhaps) someone
     keeps making typos and keeps correcting them in new commits.  If
     have time to look at the content of individual commits, then look
     at how often one developer's commit is a response to (refers to)
     some other developer's previous commit.  This tells you that
     group code review is going on, and the more of that you see, the
     better the project is doing.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Evaluate organizational diversity.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>In addition to looking for a variety of individual
     identities, see if you can tell how many different
     <span class="emphasis"><em>organizations</em></span> are participating in the
     project — in particular, commercial
     organizations.  If a number of different sources of money are all
     investing in a project, that's a sign that that project is going
     to be around for the long term.  (See the discussion of "bus
     factor" in <a class="xref" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Social and Political Infrastructure">Chapter 4, <em>Social and Political Infrastructure</em></a>.)</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>Discussion forums.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>If the project has discussion forums, scan them quickly
     looking for signs of a functional community.  Specifically,
     whenever you see a long thread, spot check responses from core
     developers coming late in the thread.  Are they summarizing
     constructively, and taking steps to bring the thread to a
     decision while remaining polite?  If you see a lot of flame wars
     going on, that's often a sign that energy is going into argument
     instead of into development.</p></dd><dt><span class="term"><span class="emphasis"><em>News, announcements, and releases.</em></span></span></dt><dd><p>Any project that is functioning well will usually have made
     announcements within the past few months.  Check the project's
     front page, news feed, Twitter or other microblog accounts, etc.
     If things are quiet on stage, they're probably quiet backstage
     too.</p></dd></dl></div><p>This is only a quick introduction to the art of evaluating
projects, but even using just the steps above can save you a lot of
trouble.  I have found them particularly useful when evaluating the
two sides of a recent fork<sup>[<a id="idm2611" href="#ftn.idm2611" class="footnote">63</a>]</sup>.  Even in
a recent fork, it is often possible to tell, just by looking at some
of the signals described above, which side will flourish over the long
term.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr/><div class="footnote"><p><sup>[<a id="ftn.idm2611" href="#idm2611" class="para">63</a>] </sup>That is, a "social fork";
